Today  we have  our <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Uruguay#Struggle_for_independence">Independence celebration</a>, we usually do not make a big deal out of it, as we actually were defeated in our first attempt, and needed the help of the English to actually become independent, but I guess it would be a different place have things not happened the way they did.<br />In spite of all the problems it's a <a href="http://www.uruguaynatural.com/">great place to live</a>.
