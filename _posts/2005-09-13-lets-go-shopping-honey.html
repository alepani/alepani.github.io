It's the 90's all over again<br /><br />eBay just bought Skype for the *incredibly ridiculous* price of 1.3 billion dollars and 38 million shares ( at the current ask price for eBay that's another 1 billion additional and some other change) plus another 1.5 b.  IF certain conditions are met .... 4.1 billion total. I'm sure they have their reasons, but <a href="http://gigaom.com/2005/09/11/skype-ebay-happening/">Om is going nuts about this</a> and I just don't know how they got so much out of the deal.<br />I'm actually sad this happened, because I fear skype will share the destiny of ICQ and hotmail and get absrbed into the big service and lose it's appeal as a high quality independent voice client... moving to Google Talk..<br /><br />In related news, one of the old school :-) CRM software giants,  Siebel Systems, got his price also, when sold to Oracle yesterday for ( get ready for this..) 5.3 Billion. Maybe somebody is expecting to challenge MS and SAP, or just beating a dead horse....?<br /><br />O tempora! O mores!
