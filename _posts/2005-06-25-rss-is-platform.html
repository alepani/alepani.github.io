Many news on the RSS side, first, Apple is pushing podcasting into iTunes 4.9, and making a big noise about it, cool. <br />Dave Winer ( of podcasting fame) over at gnomedex <a href="http://www.venturus.com/index.php?/weblog/permalink/gnomedex_50_dave_winer_keynote_06241042/">demo'ed a powerful OPML editor</a>, talked a lot about the power of RSS.<br />The <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">people at Redmond</a> seemed to agree and also announced an <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=80533">RSS API and "RSS platform"</a> for Longhorn, of course, this is integrated into Windows / IE7..:-), their new motto: "RSS everywhere"  ( embrace and extend again?)<br />Looks to me that they want to make RSS into the new XML or something, the real power of RSS is in the middle S as in "Simple". <br />Let's keep it simple :-)<br /><br />Update: Found a nice piece about the <a href="http://particletree.com/features/the-importance-of-rss">importance of RSS</a>... interesting read.
