I started having problems with the connection speed a couple of months ago. I decided to upgrade to the fastest available for home users in UY,&nbsp; which is a 4Mb Down / 512 K Up. The upload speed still sucks and in this age of collaboration and sharing, it is not only outdated but just unbelievable that this is what toy get for almost 100 dollars.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway hare are the speedtest.net results for the new connection: <br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.speedtest.net/result/510431794.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="189" src="http://www.speedtest.net/result/510431794.png" width="420" /></a></div><br />The connection inside UY is as advertised 4.0/512, and the connection to other countries&nbsp; : Argentina, Brazil and Europe is worst than to the U.S. ( usually around 2Mb down 300k Up).<br />So it looks that the international link is at top capacity, and the link to Buenos Aires in particular it's very poor.<br />Also these are average numbes, I could get slightly better or much worse speed depending on the time and day.
