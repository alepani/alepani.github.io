<span style="font-weight: bold;">Google Gears</span><br /><br />I am very impressed with the Google Gears infrastructure, the API is still limited, but as they have done to other services , it will evolve over time.<br /><br />The service is available on <a href="http://reader.google.com/">Google Reader</a> right now. And the natural fit would be Google Docs: once Presentations is in place the connected/disconnected lightweight office suite will be a credible threat to MSOffice. The problem is not that it has more or less funcionallity, it clearly has less, but it also offers persistence on the net and when you are disconnected, mobile access to the very same documents, and it's free. You can't compete in price with that.<br /><br />Other services too , are jumping in the Gears bandwagon and using the Gears platform:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">The milk! </span><br /><br /><a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/">Remember the Milk</a> is one of the first web 2.0 services I used ; ( is basically a to-do list online with extra functionality) . I always wandered why Google wouldn't get something like that in calendar; It doesn't have to ... other services will do it and provide the information for the ads :-)<br />It's amazing how easy for the user the changes are, just install gears and the disconnected application will act as if it were connected.<br /><br />A friend of mine recently commented how people use their laptops in terminals and airports: they open the machine, check if there is an open Wi-Fi network and get to work, if there are no open hotspots they close it, and put away the machine, same as if there was no battery nor electricity. With the scenarios and opportunities provided by Google Gears the mobile worker will get incredible advantages in using web apps.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Just a tiny issue</span><br /><br />No solution is perfect though and I can think of three main problems that this model can find:<br /><br />1) <span style="font-style: italic;">It's too late ? </span>.<br /><br />As the world gets more and more connected we depend on connectivity for everything, chatting, email, games, personal and work information, schedule, you  name it, there is an online version and somebody is using it ; and not all is google ( at least not yet). So even if it's true that you can make your application run off line, does it matter?. Is it worth the effort ? Is it useful to have the news reader off line and the whole application if you are 90% of your working time online..?<br /><br />2) <span style="font-style: italic;">What about really complex applications?</span><br /><br />A cache is a cache, and while you can store some data in the browser you can't store all the corporate data ( size, variability and privacy , are the top reasons) so sometimes you can't work offline. And in a big complex application ( a intranet payroll or CRM system for instance ( the opposite of RTM , Campfire or Backpack ). Then the effort is going to be really huge and you'll probably end up with a partial implementation.<br /><br />If you find that you want to run a different application or follow a link then you can't ( meaning it's not fully transparent, and then the illusion breaks )<br /><br />3) <span style="font-style: italic;">Security, privacy</span><br /><br />As you pass more and more of your data through the google machinery, everything gets used to  update your profile and serve adds.  Yo may trust google with your data, but , remember they <a href="http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&amp;ct=:ePkh8BM9E-LV4s7LzCtJzUvJV0gphtuRBLcD7IIMuG15MNuMBL5zbVhw4410QrSPI89b2diPAF_mEtE/0-0&amp;fp=466ca247df526a6b&amp;ei=BrVsRtb5IJ6MoQKk1fCzAg&amp;url=http%3A//yro.slashdot.org/article.pl%3Fsid%3D07/06/10/2019258&amp;cid=1117041684&amp;sig2=qe5cXi12wPGM1wDhuc6llg">rank very low on privacy issues</a> with various organizations.<br />Also the fact that data is cached in the browser is an invitation to hack the cache for useful info and a potential security hole. I know this is all probably encrypted and all, but still , more data to be careful with if you use a shared computer.<br /><br />Overall , in spite of the negatives, Gears seems to be a platform to explore and have "on the radar" for now.
