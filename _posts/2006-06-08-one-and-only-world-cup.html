The single most important event, in the most popular sport on the planet begins tomorrow: <br />The football  World Cup ( that's  soccer  for the US).<br /> <br />The host country Germany  has a easy match with Costa Rica.<br /><br />There are few sports that  draw this level of universal attention and fanatism, the world productivity declines, companies and countries sets meetings and schedules around the matches, piles of money are bet ( legally and illegally) around the world, and people from bolivia , france, japan and arabia and africa, tune in the TV at the same time to watch "the beautiful game".<br /><br />The US mainstream press ( and most bloggers) still struggle to make sense of the universal appeal of "soccer" with various degrees of success, but mostly they are still at odds with the most popular sport in the world.<br /><br />Anyway. Last cup (Corea/Japan 2002) I blogged after the matches and commented on my favorite teams, this year , we'll have an internal blog over at <a href="http://www.genexus.com/">ARTech </a>with comments about the games and the tournament.<br /><br /> Please check it <a href="http://blog.genexus.com/lstfutbol/">here </a> and leave your comments.<br /><br />And don't forget to follow the cup at <a href="http://www.fifaworldcup.com">FIFA's</a> site<br />
