I just switched to a new DSL plan,  with a data transfer limit of  3Gb a month, that costs me about 40 US Dollars.<br /><br />If you are surprised by this, you should know that in general broadband service in Uruguay, where I live, sucks, really. Basically you have one provider <a href="http://www.antel.com.uy/">Antel</a>  (state owned monopoly) , in a very small market, and the service is <span style="font-style: italic;">expensive</span> and unreliable, but at least it's slow :-)<br /><br />A 256/64 line ( that's a little more than modem speed) costs 50 dollars a month with "unlimited" data transfer (that's the one I previously had), in real life you never got more than 190kBps , sometimes much less. So, my new plan is to get more speed for a lower price , but you have a max. transfer of 3Gigabytes, I would have preferred 5Gb , but that's what they offer.<br /><br />It seems to be working pretty well for average surfing, blogging, email, and some regular downloads. NOT recommended if you use P2P clients, bitTorrent, etc. I had it for 10 days  now and I've used less than 1GB, so I will live 'till the end of the month.<br />I don't think this is going to be definitive, though, once my kids start to do heavy internet use or video over IP becomes more usable, limited plans will be out of the question, but for now I got twice the speed for 10 less. I'm happy:
