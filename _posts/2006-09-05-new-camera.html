<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">  <p>I just got a new camera , my trusty old Sony DSC-P9 (4 Mp 3x)  was replaced by a new<br /><a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/sonyh2/">Sony Cybershot H2</a> megazoom camera, a bigger form factor, but it's comfortable enough to carry around.</p><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/96/234437337_374fea8d19_m_d.jpg"><img style="cursor: pointer; width: 320px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/96/234437337_374fea8d19_m_d.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><p>So far the camera is good, it's not a pro cam but at 6 megapixel with 12x optical zoom, (Carl Zeiss lens), built-in image stabilization, and a small set of manual functions (similar to a SLR), it's very nice.<br /></p>  <p>Te pictures are clean but it has some low-light issues with noise, an a blue-ish tendency, normal on this kind of cameras, nothing unexpected. As I said it's not a SLR ( I would have bough a <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/sonydslra100/">Sony Alpha 100</a> or <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canoneos350d/">Canon Digital Rebel</a>, if I had an extra $600 :-) )<br /></p>  <p>Also it does 30fps 640x480 video wich is always nice.</p><p>I discovered a small problem with high megapixel cameras: they start to make your connection a bottleneck, I  upload almost all of my photos to <a href="http://flickr.com">flickr </a>, mostly to share with the family, but also as a backup,  I'll have to start choosing pictures because I am now surpassing the flickr monthly limits ( I have three kids )</p><p>Overall it's a nice camera. I recommend it.</p><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/64/234434186_d38933e514_m_d.jpg"><img style="cursor: pointer; width: 320px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/64/234434186_d38933e514_m_d.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/84/234450798_e8d4d589e4_d.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/84/234450798_e8d4d589e4_d.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><br /><p><br /></p>   <p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px;">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com" target="_new" title="Flock">Flock</a></p></div>
