<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It's been a slow blog month (or maybe several slow  months) ... I'm really busy , finishing work for my engineering degree at the <a href="http://www.ucu.edu.uy/">University</a> . Also a bit of a busy time at work finishing a new version of <a href="http://www.deklarit.com/">DK</a> .<br /><p>Actually I'll be busy for a while still. I haven't doing much browsing or blogging, but one thing I found really cool is <a href="http://www.flocker.com/">flocker , </a>wich made me switch away from firefox, the killer feature beeing integrated flickr, blogging and the use of del.icio.us tags instead of bookmarks. You can probably do the same with a firefox plugin, but this is very well integrated and based on the same firefox open source code so it's good enough. Very early software but just can't live without online favorites now...</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p></div>
