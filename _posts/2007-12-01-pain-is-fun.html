I'm at home, with a sore throat and a fever.<br />Downstairs I hear screaming, and then the sound of something hitting metal, " It hurts! "  ( one  of my kids ) , " Quick  grab the old lady"  , a while later  " Let's throw him through the glass"  ( the little one)  , " watch the wall !", then a loud sound of something breaking and  then, laughing...<br /><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_12j-6WCLPuM/R1FesETz0cI/AAAAAAAAADA/6nt0xOae8Gs/s1600-R/pain.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_12j-6WCLPuM/R1FesETz0cI/AAAAAAAAADA/QimxqMaM09Q/s320/pain.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5138992760970531266" border="0" /></a><br />No , I'm not going crazy :-) ,  my two older kids are playing <a href="http://www.us.playstation.com/PS3/Games/PAIN">PAIN</a>, which came up on the PSN this week. Basically it's a "sandbox" physics based game, where you throw your character from a giant slingshot in order to hit him against several targets ( walls , windows, cranes, signs, vehicles, and also <span style="font-style: italic;">monkeys</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">mimes</span> and yes , <span style="font-style: italic;">old ladies</span>....)<br /><br />The game is $10, a bit expensive for what is is , but for me it's worth it, although a bit limited ,  it's a lot of fun. :-)
