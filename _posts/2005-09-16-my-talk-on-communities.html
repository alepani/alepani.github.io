As  I mentioned in a previous post, there is a <a href="http://alepanizza.blogspot.com/2005_09_11_alepanizza_archive.html#112666458366653775">technical event/expo</a>, at wich I made a presentation about communities (knowledge-based online communities), why they are important, how they work, and just try to give a general introduction to the subject.<br /><br />In the presentation I mentioned some interesting examples of communities online, such as  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon reviews</a>, the Bloggers, <a href="http://www.ebay.com/">Ebay</a>,  and most notable <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia.</a><br />I didn't mentioned, however,  my current favorite community <a href="http://digg.com/">digg.com</a>, this a social bookmarking/news site that seems to work pretty well (news go up and down based on users feedback, and you can post any story that you find interesting), I abandoned <a href="http://www.slashdot.org/">slashdot</a>, about a year ago, and now I get my geek news from digg and the asociated podcast and videocast <a href="http://revision3.com/diggnation">diggnation</a><br /><br />My goal was to be able to talk to a wide ( tech and non-tech)  audience, and I think it went pretty well, anyway here's the <a href="http://genexusxv.montevideo.com.uy/66">video link</a> (in spanish) .
