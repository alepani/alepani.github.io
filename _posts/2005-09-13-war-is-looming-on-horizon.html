Services war, that is :-)<br /><br />All the big players are prepping their ammo for what it appears to be the next battle for the end-users desktops.<br /><br />We have Google with Desktop search, Sidebar, Picasa/Hello, Gmail , Blogger, and Talk ( more coming).<br /><br />Also Yahoo! with Yahoo desktop search, Konfabulator, Flickr, Yahoo Mail, 360, and Yahoo messenger ( recently added voice)<br /><br />And in this corner, the former champion, Microsoft, Microsoft Desktop search, MSN Spaces, Hotmail, Messenger ( now with a corporate version, and also a voice upgrade in the works, since they purchased a smal VOIP firm).<br /><br />Our redmond's friends have launched a beta of a Picasa/Hello like client based on WinFX <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/max/">codenamed Max !</a>, and thare is a lot of buzz around <a href="http://microsoftgadgets.com/">MS Gadgets</a> wich are a little too much like konfabulator/expose if you ask me , but actually they are Vista's sidebar panels, and will appear in <a href="http://www.microsoft-watch.com/article2/0,1995,1858799,00.asp?kc=MWRSS02129TX1K0000535">other places</a> as well<br /><br />I find really interesting to watch these developments, but , how cool it would be ( never will happen, but ... to dream is free...) if you can interop say flickr with MN Spaces/messenger, and GMail and Google desktop search... :-).<br /><br />C'mon guys, all you need is love ....
