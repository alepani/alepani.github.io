<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://hacketyhack.net/images/design/Hacky-Mouse-Hand.png"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 320px;" src="http://hacketyhack.net/images/design/Hacky-Mouse-Hand.png" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />I began my interest in <a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby">Ruby</a>, long before the current <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">rails</a> craze.<br />Now that it has been getting support from everywhere, I had a variety of reasons for revisiting this nice language.<br />One of the main attractions of Ruby is how easy is to code, and how concise the syntax is.<br /><br />My new finding is called <a href="http://hacketyhack.net/">Hackety hack </a>.<br />This started as a manifesto: "<a href="http://whytheluckystiff.net/articles/theLittleCodersPredicament.html">The little coder's predicament</a>", now it's a programming enviroment for beginners.<br />It's only available in Ruby for now, but the author says  that there will be versions for another languages ( scheme, python ?? ).<br /><br />The beauty of this interactive tool is that you don't need previous code experience in Ruby or in any language, and that you can write meaningful code : i.e. no calculators or string parsers, but web blog software and mp3 players, really cool stuff.<br /><br />I think this could be a really cool way to introduce kids to programming, my current favorite is <a href="http://www.squeak.org/">squeak</a> ( another mouse ! ) ; because I think is more abstract/math oriented toward problem solving .<br />But as a tool to learn Ruby this is really good. Recommended for 13 and up.<br /><br />Check the <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">official Ruby site</a>.
