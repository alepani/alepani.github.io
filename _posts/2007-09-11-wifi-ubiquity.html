It's crunch-time for us as we near the <a href="http://www.genexus.com/portal/hgxpp001.aspx?2,47,699,O,E,,,">GX international  meeting</a> . The time of the year when we present the new directions in which we are working, and the products that are about to come out from Artech.<br />Also we have the opportunity to chat informally with the top GX developers who are working in a variety of applications and get feedback about <a href="http://www.genexus.com/">Genexus</a>.<br /><br />Usually crunch-time means staying late, fast-food and lack of sleep. It still does, but with a twist.<br /><br />For the past years I was working on Deklarit, I was out of service during summer ( in the south that mens Dec-Jan-Feb)  ; and just recently began to help the main developer team with <a href="http://www.gxopen.com/commwiki/servlet/hwiki?Welcome+to+GeneXus+Rocha,">Genexus Rocha</a> so, I'm a bit out of the loop. Still work has to be done, and we have as much as we can handle.<br /><br />Last weekend was the opportunity to unwind a little so I got the wife and kids to <a href="http://www.maldonado.gub.uy/puntadeleste1.php">Punta del Este</a> (a.k.a. paradise :-) ), but couldn't help to bring along the laptop to work on my presentation.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/panizza/1355343096/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1218/1355343096_b235fd00a4_b.jpg" alt="DSC02829.JPG" width="512" height="384" /></a><br /><br /><br />We checked four hotels before settling on one and to my surprise three of them had wifi b/g for the guests. On top of that there was no additional charge, login or complications to get on the net, just opened my laptop,  saw three APs ( two for the hotel, one for the hotel around the corner)  and connected right away.<br /><br />I personally think this is great, Hotel owners are not stupid, and the more people requested internet access (outside a computer in the lobby),  more hotels started to add wifi service.<br />Punta is a small town and if all of them offered free and open Wifi, the city will be pretty much covered.
