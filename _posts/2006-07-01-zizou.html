I never though this could happen after watching France's dissapointing early games; but today Zinedine Zidane,  played the game of his life and  probably  gave the best performance of a single player in 2006 World Cup.<br />Leading a strong France team, made a stunning display of talent against Brazil of all teams, at one moment I forgot they were playing the 5 time world champions.... and they did too :-)<br />Zidane was dribbling and deceiving like he was playing a socond class team , hoping the ball over Ronaldo, and passing Roberto Carlos like he was a road sign.<br />Overall a wonderful game, that got me rooting for the Frenchs, if for no other reason that they are the only ones left that showed they can play beautiful   futbol, fussball ,football or soccer<br />Whatever....
