I was having a conversation with <a href="http://evoluzination.blogspot.com/2007/01/ipods-versus-cell-phones.html">Cecilia about convergence</a> of iPods and cellphones...<br />bad timing, because, the folks at Apple did it again: today they introduced a product in an existing category that made everything else obsolete in a product-of-a-previous-civilization kind of way.<br />The <a href="http://feeds.engadget.com/%7Er/weblogsinc/engadget/%7E3/73008973/">iPhone </a>apparently has a killer screen, revolutionary touch interface , music, movies, and somehow runs OSx ( which means Safari , iTunes, and widgets)- No 3g though - .<br />Available in June from cingular : <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">Apple's site  </a><br />By the way , CES came and went and nothing interesting except big TV's...<br />If I were Motorola and Samsung I'd be very worried. Right now.<br />History <a href="http://www.thomas-fitzgerald.net/2007/01/17/reaction-to-the-iphone-reveals-how-the-electronics-industry-failed-to-beat-the-ipod/">repeats itself</a>
