I  don't  wan't to make this into a "quote" or "link" blog  . but here it is the first post of the year :<br /> Tyler Cowen <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2006/01/further_subject.html">final impressions of argentina</a> are pretty much correct, and a good guide for an american coming south. I would add a comment on medical tourism that (especially cosmetic and dental) that happens to be a growing industry in Buenos Aires.  <br /><br /><div style="text-align: left;">Coyote has an <a href="http://www.coyoteblog.com/coyote_blog/2006/01/cooler_but_poor.html">excelent post on global warming</a> that frames the debate looking at the consequence of the ( impractical ) proposed solution.<br /><br />I linked the two posts because of the enviromental controversy between Uruguay and Argentina, wich I found absurd that a country that has a nuclear plant, oil refineries, all sorts of "dirty" industries , and then, they got suddenly worried about the enviroment over a pulp mill in a  50,000 people zone..... Some insightful <a href="http://www.montevideo.com.uy/noticia_25249_1.html">articles</a>  can <a href="http://bustismos.blogspirit.com/">explain the point</a> , for those who don't get it ....(in spanish)<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
