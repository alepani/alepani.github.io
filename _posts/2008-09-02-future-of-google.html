I just watched an interview with Eric Schmidt, talking about Google's earnings and , they are impressive,  the main point is that even in tough economics times, <span style="font-style: italic;">especially</span> in tough economic times, targeted advertising is  a better value than TV ads, or regular ads, because; for obvious reasons; they are better for advertisers, but also, they are better for consumers...<br /><br />Schmidt also makes a point that they have no monopoly power like MSFT because their users can switch  providers with "one click", which is absolutely true.<br /><br />That is great, but it highlights again that Google's core business is advertising, their <span style="font-style: italic;">only</span> core business. I don't think they are making money in "Apps for your Domain", certainly not in the Gmail, GCal, etc "Betas".<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;font-size:130%;" >The Cellphone</span><br /><br />Now the third wave of Google products is coming, the Android handsets, I am all for new platforms, but JAVA ??? what are they thinking ...and the hardware, delayed, until some photos showed up recently , the HTC designed handsets :<br /><br />the qwerty :<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.celularis.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/androidlive.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px;" src="http://www.celularis.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/androidlive.JPG" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><a href="http://www.celularis.com/htc/primer-telefono-con-android-y-es-htc.php">http://www.celularis.com/htc/primer-telefono-con-android-y-es-htc.php</a><br />( horrible is the word used in this blog...)<br /><br />The newer-almost-final HTC device:<br /><br />in <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/08/30/htcs-android-driven-dream-revealed-in-glorious-spy-photos/">Gizmodo</a><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.blogsmithmedia.com/www.engadget.com/media/2008/08/attachment-4.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px;" src="http://www.blogsmithmedia.com/www.engadget.com/media/2008/08/attachment-4.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />" Looks like it was designed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LADA">LADA</a> engineers " ( not my words)<br /><br />The hardware is not very different than WinMo devices with is not very surprising, back in the day of Symbian vs. Windows Mobile, it was pretty obvious that Symbian was doomed ( at least Nokia), mainly because of  moore's law and the ease of programming in other platforms.<br /><br />Now the major  players are  three and it's all in the software:<br /><br />* Windows mobile, I'm waiting to see Winmo 7 wich promise iPhone-like multitouch and a lot of new features...<br /><br />* Android ( including probably Nokia and some korean manufacturers , sooner or later)<br /><br />and<br /><br />*  Apple, yes there's also  Apple and this phone they have, which is easy to use , cool, and they can't make fast enough.... they should worry about them....<br /><br />Android and MS are coming behind with touch, central application store, and a serious developer program ( to be fair MS already had one, but the variety of devices  made a mess of things)<br /><br />MS Devices look way better now, the HTC Touch Pro and Diamond show the way, but they are incredible overpriced , they haven't got a standard feature set , and still are not made for a general audience, it's "windows in a small screen", they need a rewrite of the UI in 7.<br /><br />HTC S740:<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.blogsmithmedia.com/www.engadget.com/media/2008/08/htc-war-top.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px;" src="http://www.blogsmithmedia.com/www.engadget.com/media/2008/08/htc-war-top.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/08/30/htc-wars-touch-pro-touch-diamond-and-s740-go-head-to-head/">Gizmodo again</a>..<br /><br />Google software looks kind of OK, but no match for the Cupertino guys. The Java Developer side is very open , but kind of raw at this point. and nobody has seen a real device or price yet.<br /><br />The soft spot for Apple is the developer program, that is<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Objective C</span>, and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mac only</span>.<br />A genius move would be release SDK for Windows and/or any scripting language ( Python, Ruby, your pick Steve :-)   )<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;font-size:130%;" >The Browser</span><br /><br />The third installment of the browser wars is starting, and make no mistake Microsoft is still on the lead , and a very comfortable one.<br /><br />They trashed Mozilla, and got kicked by It's leaner meaner reincarnation: Firefox.<br />now, there is a browser for every taste, if you are in a Mac you got Safari and Camino, in Windows  IE, and and Safari for Windows, plus  Firefox , WebKit, Flock and Opera in every platform....<br /><br />Now The Desktop is not longer the only battleground, you got mobiles , tablets, touchpads...<br /><br />So Google's latest (rumored) announcement <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/08/30/htc-wars-touch-pro-touch-diamond-and-s740-go-head-to-head/">is a Browser</a>... called "chrome" with a faster mulltithreaded JS engine, all Open Source.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://cache.gizmodo.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/09/googlechrome.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px;" src="http://cache.gizmodo.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2008/09/googlechrome.png" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />The problem is that the Browser no longer matters much, the real battle is in web platforms, they are triying to build around the Os a platform,<br />wich leads to my final Google initiative...:<br /><br /><span style="font-size:130%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">App Engine</span></span><br /><br />  App Engine is Googles "Infrastructure as a service" or "Cloud Based platform"<br /><br /> Again they are late to the party behind Amazon, and others.<br /><br /> The google AppEngine is a Python based aplication repository,  with BigTable as the database.<br /><br /> The competitors for AppEngine have a lot of value added, Amazon, provides full blown virtual machines , your pick of DBMS, (S3 , mySQL or whatever) and Language (anything you can run in the machine),  and they have the maturity to charge for the staff and doing fine.<br /><br />Facebook also have their online platform, and beside providing a robst infrastrucure, no cost development, they are bringing a social net of 100 million of potential users ...<br /><br />Microsoft is working on something , probably C#/Silverlight based dso they have another guy to worry about.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;font-size:130%;" >Finally</span><br /><br />The point of all this is (or was) I've lost the path of the argument... :-)<br />is that Google is making insane amounts of money , but, they have one (1) profitable business, <span style="font-style: italic;">search based ads</span>.<br /><br />They have at least half  a dozen big important projects ( Android, Mail,  Google Apps, Appengine, Health, The Browser, Desktop Search, Blogger , Picasa, etc)  that don't make any money and are not even close to being a full featured product , and in some cases are way behind what's currently available.<br /><br />Is Search the only thing Google can do ? Certaily not, they are too smart for that , but they have to take the expansion thing Microsoft-seriously or sooner or later they will be a commodity.
