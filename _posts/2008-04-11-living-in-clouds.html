Yep, turns out Dave and Om <a href="http://alepanizza.blogspot.com/2008/03/recycling-recycled-posts.html">were right</a> about the pigs thing.<br />Google just launched <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">App Engine</a>, a new storage and application service, free for now, (pay a premium later if you need bandwidth or storage ).<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.appscout.com/images/AppEngine.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px;" src="http://www.appscout.com/images/AppEngine.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />It's covered everywhere, but the highlights are: BigTable as DB , Python and supports  Python libraries , dJango and  compatible  frameworks. All Python and BigTable, no C, no SQL.<br /><br />Direct hit for Bungee and Amazon, and a good and cheap way to fund startup projects. If you have a lot of hits they might buy your app :-)<br /><br />The more interesting parts from an IT standpoint are<br /><ol><li> infrastructure and hosting as commodity.</li><li>Non relational DBMSes gaining ground for cloud-based apps , web 2.0 and document apps.</li></ol>   I have more on point 2 soon.
