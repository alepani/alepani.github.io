If you are the average geek ( or aspiring geek), you probably have a broadband connection and a Wifi Router ( I have a linksys WRT54GS ), then you should take care of your Wifi security.<br />I 've brought a Pocket PC from work (it has WiFi built in), and walking around my neighborhood, I've found at least two Access Points with no security at all.<br />So you should use WEP encryption right ? Wrong<br />as <a href="http://whoppix.hackingdefined.com/Whoppix-wepcrack.html">this flash movie proves</a>, anybody can crack WEP security in 10 minutes, it's like crackin for dummies...<br />So what's a family man to do ? <br />I need my wife's notebook and mine's connected, and I have 802.11b and .11g cards, so while WPA /AES based security would be nice, it's not an option.<br />MAC filtering works fine for me so i only allow this two particular cards to connect to the network, and I still use security to prevent sniffing, just in case<br /><br /> " You are not paranoic, they ARE watching you.."
