As I said in a previous post, I have a Wireless G Linksys Router, most of the time it works well, but, for some reason, there are places in the house that the signal won't reach. Also there are several intermitent issues, like sometimes it's working fine and for no apparent reason, I loss the signal.<br />Last week I've listened to an <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail558.html">interview </a>over at <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/">ITConversations</a>, (very good show, I listen it in my car on the way to work), where the president of <a href="http://www.airgonetworks.com">Airgo Networks</a> discussed the MIMO technology and it's advantages, this technology is part of 802.11n, the next generation of Wifi standards, and, apparently it has both more speed, and range than 802.11g, using the same bandwith. Also I've found that Intel has<a href="http://gigaom.com/2005/06/18/intel-develops-an-80211-everything-chip/"> developed a chip</a> that integrates a,b,g and n all the 802.11 "flavors" at low cost to be used in notebooks.<br />So, I am looking forward to the ratification of the 802.11n standard and get myself a new Wifi Kit ( there are already several "pre-N" wireless products out there but I rather wait for the "official" stuff, so I don't have any compatibility issues).<br />I just wish I had spare money to buy a Wifi Skypephone by that time....
