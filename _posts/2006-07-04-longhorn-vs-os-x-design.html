Over at Functioning form there is <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?306">a  post about the different desing philosophies</a> and goals at Redmond and Cupertino, the designers of the UI talk about the situation, the goals, the process and everithing else at <a href="http://2006.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels/?action=show&id=IAP060013&amp;PHPSESSID=97b63d1cd07c059e1126d2a4425e9e83">SXSW conference</a>.<br />Still is interesting to see how much in common the two desing have and there is a bonus Q&amp;A about the future of UIs in general: File , Edit, View menu should be gone, Media center like interfaces, etc.
