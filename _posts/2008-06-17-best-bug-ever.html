A patch introduced a bug in the MMO Age of Conan...<br /><br />    <a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=144497">http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=144497</a><br /><br />I think the press release says it all...<br /><br />"Funcom can confirm that some of the female models in the game have had the size of their breasts changed," .... "This is due to an unintended change in data that was introduced in an earlier patch, data which controls the so-called morph value associated with character models and the size of their respective body parts. We are working on a fix for this and your breasts should be back to normal soon."
