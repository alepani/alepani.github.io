Yes, maybe it's a little exageration, but the <a href="http://toyfair06.asmzine.com/lego/lego-mindstorms/">LEGO Mindstorm NXT</a>, scheduled to release in August 2006, its the coolest toy I've seen in a while. The idea is to build robots using the kits , the parts are similar to the tecnics? line, and program them  using a graphical language.<br /><br />There is a lot of robot toys nowadays, here's a <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/ptech/02/10/toyfair.ap/">CNN article</a>   , the site of <a href="http://www.wowwee.com/">WowWee</a> ( another robot maker)<br /><br />The mindstorm NXT has a 32 bit processor/screen inside a brick. It can be connected to a lot of sensors ( think touch/ light / direction / sound / ultrasonic) servos and motors ,etc<br />Programmable  via USB from Mac and PCs<br />I am very interested in this, a great blog to check on the subject is the<a href="http://thenxtstep.blogspot.com/"> NXT blog</a><br /><br />The education site <a href="http://legoeducation.typepad.com/blog">http://legoeducation.typepad.com/blog</a> has a blog explaining how the new sensors differs from the previous version.<br /><s>I *have* to have one </s> this would make a great birthday gift for my kids ...
