As I write this words I am downloading the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista/getready/preview.mspx">Windows Vista Beta 2</a>  trial,  ( MS servers took forever to respond last week , but apparently they are feeling better). I'll give it a try at my home machine and I really want to see how the hardware handles the WinFX stuff.<br /><br />Also I am downloading some wierd anime <a href="http://www.animesuki.com/">torrents</a>, tech podcasts, and watching the funny intro of <a href="http://www.ted.com/tedtalks/tedtalksplayer.cfm?key=david_pogue&flashEnabled=1">David Pogue's conference</a> at <a href="http://www.ted.com/">TED</a>. So I am finally usnig my bandwith to it's full potential.<br /><br />But I'm going to the point of this.... There is an ongoing discussion about the next step in information/computer/internet technology or more precisely who/when will a truly intelligent web will appear, <a href="http://evolvingtrends.wordpress.com/2006/06/28/diggs-biggest-flaw-discovered/">some</a> <a href="http://evolvingtrends.wordpress.com/2006/06/26/wikipedia-30-the-end-of-google/">opinions </a>says google is doomed and the semantic web will evolve into a better way to "organize the world's information" , some disagree , even <a href="http://www.valleywag.com">valleywag</a> <a href="http://www.valleywag.com/tech/google/five-reasons-no-one-will-replace-google-183892.php">took a side</a>.<br />I have discussed this before with many peeople at work, where they know their AI much better than me, and I am ultimately divided: my rational part want to think that ontologies, semantics and symbolic reasoning/processing are the way to a true AI implementation.<br />But the "brute force" approach of Google is working wonders, and by that I mean <span style="font-style: italic;">highly intelligent statistical analysis of huge amounts of data and its relations</span>,  and seems to have the edge for now, and unless there is some changes google will do it first.
