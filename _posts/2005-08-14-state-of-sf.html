If you are not a SF fan, feel free to skip this post. It's going to be a long one...<br /><br />*WARNING* Amazon Links Ahead *WARNING*<br /><br />I've been reading science fiction since I was 13 ( that would be 1983), My first SF novels were really crappy paperback shit. Then I met the "gods" of SF : Asimov (Foundation Series, the Robots novels), A.C.Clarke, Heinlein, Phil K. Dick, Stevenson, J.Blish, Brian Aldiss, Paul Anderson, etc  (too many to name them all)<br />It was old material, but new to me.<br /><br />The next step, was to look for something new, that part was difficult, having read excelent SF, the novels at that time seemed not up to the same standard. But I continued to read anyway, more SF than anything else, until I came across William Gibson, needless to say it was something new and clever, since  I was already into Computers,  naturally I was hooked into this new style. I liked most Gibson novels, but specially the short stories and Idoru. <br /><br />Then, there was a huge wave of Gibson, imitators, I read some, nothing interesting...<br /><br />During the 90's I went back to classic ( space opera, big scenarios, evil aliens) SF, primary I've been reading Jack Vance, and mostly Iain Banks "culture" series, if you haven't read it I do recommend to try at least <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0061053562/qid, =1124061342/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/102-6244081-6543336?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">"The Player of Games"</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0553292242/qid=1124061394/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/102-6244081-6543336?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">"The use of Weapons"</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1857231384/qid=1124061384/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/102-6244081-6543336?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">"Consider Phlebas"</a> these are his best novels.<br /><br />Now that the initial Gibson future is almost here :-), fans like me have a lot of free material online , and is not bad at all. <br /><br />Aside from the usual "hard" science fiction ( of wich I consider Will Mccarty, and his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/15601/ref=pd_fr__fav/102-6244081-6543336">"Queendom of Sol" series</a>, the best current writer) there are two new styles that I find very interesting, the first one is what I call post-gibson, wich is not a very adequate name, buy I cannot think of a better one, ( that woud be "wired SF"), this novels explore the social consequences of hyperconnected societies, and global markets. Some of them like Cory Doctorow, and recent Hugo winner <a href="http://www.goldengryphon.com/Stross-Concrete.html">Charles Stross</a> are pretty good and even offer their work under CC licence, so you can read them for free.<br />The second style is what you can call "historical" SF ( it's more like Fantasy Fiction), where the authors explore historical events ( even pre-historical ones) and intermix them with fictional characters and/or alternate realities. <br />In this line my favorites are Neal Stepenson's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0380788624/qid=1124162618/sr=8-2/ref=pd_bbs_2/102-6244081-6543336?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">Cryptonomicon </a>and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0380977427/qid=1124162618/sr=8-6/ref=pd_bbs_6/102-6244081-6543336?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">The Barocque Cycle</a> <br />and more recently  Robert J. Sawyer who is a Canadian author, using Paleonthological extrapolations and parallel universes as a backdrop for wonderfull stories like  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0312876920/qid=1124162321/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-6244081-6543336?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">Hominids</a> , <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0312876912/qid=1124162321/sr=8-2/ref=pd_bbs_2/102-6244081-6543336?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">Humans</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0312876904/qid=1124162321/sr=8-5/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/102-6244081-6543336?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">Hybrids</a>.<br /><br />So if anybody had read any of this authors/books and like to leave a comment, I would appreciate, and if you have an author to recommend that it's not mentioned in the post , please do so.
