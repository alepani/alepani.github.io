I used to have a couple of RSS readers on my machine, one synched to outlook for work related stuff , and the other for news and interest in a separate reader program that will also store and update feeds periodically.<br /><br />One day I discovered <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a>; an online feed reader , it quickly became my reader of choice and never used and off line reader again. The advantages were too much to pass, all my computers synchronized with the news I hadn't read , supporting also various media types ( podcast, etc) and allowing to save post in a folder and/or blog directly from Bloglines.<br /><br />Bloglines was simple and easy to use, the only problem i have are "growing pains" the downtime of the site has become really a problem ; and the behaviour is erratic: at the time of this writing it's up but won't show my subscriptions.<br /><br />Fortunately I have my OPML file handy and now I'm trying other online readers, major contenders are <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/">Google Reader</a> and <a href="http://www.rojo.com/">Rojo</a>.<br />Here's a nice <a href="http://weblogs.hitwise.com/leeann-prescott/2007/01/web_based_feed_readers.html">roundup </a>of online readers.<br /><br />I liked Bloglines better, but I need to read the news daily and it just refuses to work I'll try both for a while and decide...<br /><br />( If anybody knows a good online feed reader please let me know)<br /><br />I've got two big lessons out of this , nothing new, but makes you think anyway...<br /><br />1. As more and more of the apps we relay on ( mail , news, photos, documents) are stored online; we must trust companies with important data. Besides privacy issues the reliability of the company becomes a critical issue, here a big-name company ( Google , Ms or Yahoo) gives you more confidence than say Bloglines or a no-name online mail company. This is where acquisitions come in I Trust more in Flickr or Picasa <span style="font-style: italic;">because</span> they where purchased by  Yahoo and Google than I would otherwise ( not that I didn't trust before, but it's something positive )<br /><br /> 2. Standards . We need open , good/better and <span style="font-style: italic;">reliable</span> standards for our formats; like OPML for feed subs/ maybe Opendoc for documents and some sort of email archiving ( that I am not aware that exists if it does). So in case a service fails or we decide to change from one to another you can be up and running fast.<br /><br /> Ah, and always have a local backup in an external drive with everything you upload.
