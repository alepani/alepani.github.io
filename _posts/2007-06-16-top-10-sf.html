Marc Andreessen post a list with <a href="http://blog.pmarca.com/2007/06/top_10_science_.html">Top 10 SF writers of the '00s</a> : I ' m ok with Vernor Vinge,  Charles Stross, and Richard Morgan; But obviously I have not read as much as him , because I am not familiar with some of the names in the list.<br /><br />I would like, however to add will McCarthty  ( The Collapsium, To Crush the Moon) and Iain M. Banks ( the Culture Series) to the list both are wonderful writers and wonderful series.
