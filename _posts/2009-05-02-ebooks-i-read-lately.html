I know is late to reccommend books from 2008 but let's make it a "fiscal" year, it's so 2008 :-) . But I'm going for it anyay.<br /><br />Fiction<br />  The<a bitly="BITLY_PROCESSED" href="http://www.amazon.com/Way-Shadows-Night-Angel-Trilogy/dp/0316033677/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1241239112&amp;sr=8-4"> <i>Night Angel Trilogy</i></a> (Brent Weeks), these are actualy three separate books: The Way of the Shadows, Shadow's Edge, and  Beyond the Shadows but #2 and #3 pretty much require reading #1. Teh best Fantasy novels I read in many years.<br /><br />  <a bitly="BITLY_PROCESSED" href="http://www.amazon.com/Singularity-Sky-Charles-Stross/dp/0441011799/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1241239348&amp;sr=1-1">Singularty Sky</a> By Charles Stross. A technological singularity hits a  cold war totalitarian state. Excellent , Stross and Cory Doctorow are becoming my fave SF writers .<br /><br />  <i><a bitly="BITLY_PROCESSED" href="http://www.amazon.com/Matter-Iain-M-Banks/dp/0316005371/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1241239225&amp;sr=1-1">Matter</a>  </i>( Ian M. Banks) . I'm a fan of The Culture series, and this was very good , not the best though. <i>The Player of Games</i> still rocks.<br /><br />Non Fiction:<br /><br /> <a bitly="BITLY_PROCESSED" href="http://www.amazon.com/Here-Comes-Everybody-Organizing-Organizations/dp/0143114948/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1241239189&amp;sr=1-1"><i>Here comes everybody</i></a> , An optimistic take on the future of media consumers and producers; and the inner works of different organizations,  by Clay Shirky. Very provocative ideas. It gets repetitive, but worth a look.<br /><br /><a bitly="BITLY_PROCESSED" href="http://www.amazon.com/Stuff-Thought-Language-Window-Nature/dp/0670063274">The Stuff of Thought</a> ( Steven Pinker)  Classic Pinker,  entertainment , funny and full of wisdom about human nature, expect no less.<br /><br /><a bitly="BITLY_PROCESSED" href="http://www.amazon.com/My-Stroke-Insight-Scientists-Personal/dp/0452295548/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1241239094&amp;sr=8-1"><i>A Stroke of Insight</i></a> ( Jill B. Taylor ) The story of a stroke , told from the point of view of the patient who happens to be a world class neuroscientist.  Easily the best nonfiction book of the lot.  highly recommended.    The best of the pack.<br /><br /><br />This is my third year of "reading electronically" and I found myself addicted to it, so much in fact that I roll my eyes at the prospect of having to read an <i>actual</i> paper book, so heavy and impractical. I does not make me read or buy more books, but it allows me to read more than one at a time, anywhere, and I appreciate that<br /><br />  The downside of electronics books, is mainly two things:<br /><br />  <b>Cost</b>  : Everybody thinks in terms of costs , but if you read a lot ( and I read a good amount) you'll offset the cost in 2  years ( unless you lose it or break it , then is another device and another $300/$400 or so)  that's because electronics content is cheaper than paper books, doesn't have shipping costs, and there are tons of free electronic books on google or project gutemberg and in the end you actually can save the cost of the device.<br /> I really think that with the <a bitly="BITLY_PROCESSED" href="http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Amazons-Wireless-Reading-Generation/dp/B00154JDAI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=electronics&amp;qid=1241239886&amp;sr=8-1">kindle2</a> , the <a bitly="BITLY_PROCESSED" href="http://www.sonystyle.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10551&amp;storeId=10151&amp;langId=-1&amp;productId=8198552921665562069">PRS-700 (Sony)</a>, and the number cof books available now, electronic books will have finally a critical mass to take  off. The tipping point for me is eInk technollogy, is really something else, you have to see it for yourself in action before dismissing it as yet another display technology.<br /><br /> <b>Availability of content</b> : The entry of Amazon in the game of electronic books is a really important thing, the number of electronic books have multiplied several times in the past two years. And others stores have started to show a better catalog and lower prices. The format also matters, Amazon has it's own format, but readers are increasingly adopting open formats ( .epub) or more established ones (pdfs) .
