My old laptop was a  toshiba satellite S5205 series, it was a fairly good laptop, with a pentium desktop 4, a high resolution ( 1400x1200) screen , and a great pair of HK speakers.<p>Unfortunately it died a horrible dead in a freaky accident involving a nylon case and a bottle of coke... I'm not going into much detail here :-) , except to say that the repair costs were more than a new low end machine.</p><p>So.. I decided to go for a new one, I wasn't planning to buy a new laptop until next year , but I needed one,  so I went shopping with what little cash I had.. The HPs , compaqs,  averatecs, alienwares, and Dells and Sonys were considered,  and discarded, I like sony's design, and Dell quality  but I ended up buying toshiba again.</p><p>The final decision was in favor of a <a href="http://www.toshibadirect.com/td/b2c/cmod.to?seg=HHO&coid=-29486&amp;sel=0&rcid=-26367&amp;ccid=1291021">satellite M45</a>. I wanted a 15 inch ( not more) and a Pentium M ( I'm done with desktop processors )<br /></p><p style="text-align: center;">Four main reasons:</p><ul><li>Design, it's not as sleek as a sony  but it's nicer looking than any other box around at the price</li><li>Firewire ( the only one offering Firewire ports standard in low end models)</li><li>Price : it costs $1400 for a Pentium M/ 1 GB / 100G hd /wxga trubrite machine almost 500 less than a similar configured competitor..</li><li>Double layer DVD writer / Multiformat card reader/ S-Video Out/ wifi  all built in</li></ul><p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pros:</span>   The machine is fast, it  has a massive hd, good wifi range,  and it's lighter than the one I had also , it has a DVD burner that can record on almost any format.</p><p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">    Cons:</span>   Good speakers , but not near as good as the 5205,  lower resolution screen,  trackpad was better in previous versions, ( no scroll wheel in trackpad), No external battery level indicator.</p>Overall I'm satisfied, but not thrilled with the machine, It's clearly the result of a mix of technology advancement, well thought features  and cost cutting. But it's a budget machine and at 1400 It's a great deal.<br /><p>Some images follow:</p><p>Size comparison...<br /></p><p style="text-align: center;"> <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/29/66047186_7d3a9d6d3e.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 320px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/29/66047186_7d3a9d6d3e.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a></p><br /><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><br /><p><br /></p><br /><p><br /></p><br /><br /><p style="text-align: center;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/33/66047372_ee2f1de4c2.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/33/66047372_ee2f1de4c2.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a></p><p>The old and the new ...<br /></p><p><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/24/66047309_d1529dd1ed.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/24/66047309_d1529dd1ed.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a></p><p><br /></p>
