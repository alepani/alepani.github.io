For the semantic web fans out there: ( you know who you are)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.powerset.com/">Powerset</a> is now up and running, the startup semantic search is now pulling content from wikipedia and a few other sources...<br />Watch the demo video <a href="http://vimeo.com/994819">here</a>, and then try it, it's been slowing down all morning ( probably heavy traffic) , but the results are very good ( not great ) , but they are in the right direction, I think.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_12j-6WCLPuM/SChuNSqst1I/AAAAAAAAAFQ/1Sa1uK2y4Fg/s1600-h/PSImage.PNG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 375px; height: 203px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_12j-6WCLPuM/SChuNSqst1I/AAAAAAAAAFQ/1Sa1uK2y4Fg/s320/PSImage.PNG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5199526944427521874" border="0" /></a><br />The news is f<a href="http://searchengineland.com/080512-000100.php">rom GigaOM</a>, and a detailed explanation of the implementation is <a href="http://searchengineland.com/080512-000100.php">here</a>,<br /><br />From what I read from various sources, they have PARC-licenced natural language technology + some proprietary stuff; and they are using Hadoop + Hbase for their processing needs .
