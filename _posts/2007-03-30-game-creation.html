It's been a long time, I have been busy at work , and smashing greek monsters in <a href="http://www.godofwar.com/">God of War</a> :-).<br /><br />I have been very interested in how to teach kids to program lately ; and a friend  sent me a link (via <a href="http://blog.wired.com/geekdad/2007/03/turn_your_kids_.html">geekdad </a>) to a software that combines teaching programming with making games: called <a href="http://www.clickteam.com/eng/tgf2.php">Game Factory 2</a>.<br /><br />This "game"  lets kids make games and teaches them the basic of modern programming: events, conditions and objects, it's called game factory 2.<br /><br />My kids  (  6 and 9 )  love it,  and are now making their first "levels" of their own.<br /><br />It's very simple but if your kid is inclined to drawing and design this will grab his/her attention and will prepare the way for him to more advanced logic and programming enviroments. It's also a great and <span style="font-style: italic;">fun </span> way to spend time playing with the family.
