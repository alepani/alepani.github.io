Author <a href="http://www.michaelcrichton.net/">Micheal Crichton</a> Died at 66, last week.<br />It was probably the only "mainstream" novelist that I liked to read, their books , while not always great were interesting and entertaining. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/06/books/06crichton.html?ex=1241586000&amp;en=a9332a50cb3b665c&amp;ei=5087&amp;excamp=GGGNmichaelcrichton&amp;WT.srch=1&amp;WT.mc_ev=click&amp;WT.mc_id=GN-S-E-GG-NA-S-michael_crichton">Here's more</a> from the NYT.
