<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Regardless of the features of IE 7, or the upcoming Firefox version, I have to say they have a lot to do if they want to be my "browser of choice", I have not only installed <a href="http://www.flock.com">flock </a>in my three machines and using it for months (home, laptop and work ), but also managed to convince 3 of my co-workers to try it, and they never looked back. </p>  <p>What is so great ?</p>  <p>Nothing much, really , but as they say, the devil is in the details: a Blog editor, with multiple blogs and mutiple engine support, online favorites using delicious and other services, photobucket and flickr uploading/browsing and search  fully integrated, search through history, favorites, google, yahoo, etc, . Everything integrated, a fantastic RSS reader .....and support for all the usual favorite firefox extensions : Bugmenot, Greasemonkey, Undoclosetab....<br /></p>  <p>The only thing I dont quite like about the last version is that they require a new window for photo uploading , I kind of preferred the old "developer preview" way.</p>  <p>But If you are tired of adding extensions to firefox, synching favorites, or (god forbid ) still using IE ,check it out<br /></p>  <p><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2006/06/15/the-definitive-flock-beta-1-review/">Paul Stamatiou's review</a> and download Flock <a href="htttp://www.flock.com">here</a>.<br /></p><br /><p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px;">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com" target="_new" title="Flock">Flock</a></p></div>
