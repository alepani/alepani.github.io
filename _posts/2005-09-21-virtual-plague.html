I thought I had seen everything when the <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1040-823260.html">Everquest economy</a> started to grow, you can see Everquest characters selling for one or two <span style="font-style: italic;">thousand </span>dollars on EBay (there is a good <a href="http://www.wired.com/">wired</a> piece (pre-bubble) <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,20984,00.html">here</a>.<br /><br />But, of course, reality ( or should I say virtuality :-) ?) is stranger than you can imagine:There is a plague, an epidemic, in World of Warcraft, <a href="http://joi.ito.com/archives/2005/09/21/plague_on_world_of_warcraft.html">details</a> via Joi Ito<br /><br />Basically the update on the game engine brought a new disease, that every character in the game ( Players and NPCs), can get and spread, is like ebola or avian flu, but in the virtual world. Of course the WOWHO ( World of Warcraft Health Organization ) is taking the apropiate measures to isolate infected cities [insert Katrina related joke here]....<br />I just hope, this thing doesn't get into my PS2 ....
