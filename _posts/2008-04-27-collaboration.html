Clay Shirky , might be right or wrong about things , but he certainly makes compelling arguments... his last article is about the new book "Here comes everybody" and makes an interesting case.<br /><a href="http://www.herecomeseverybody.org/2008/04/looking-for-the-mouse.html">Read the article</a> and, think about it.<br /><br /><br />The book is at amazon there is a link in the sidebar , if you want to buy it , feel free to use it.... :-) ,<br />incase you're asking, both books are the same, the expensive one is Hardcover.
