I used <a href="http://www.flock.com/">Flock</a> for a long time , mainly for the online favorites and ease of uploading <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">flicker </a>pictures ( the original flickr uploader , crashed a lot) . With <a href="http://www.getfirefox.com/">Firefox 2</a> and the del.icio.us bookmarks extension, or the native support for online bookmarks, and the newest more stable version of  flicker uploader integrated in Windows XP explorer . There was no need for it.<br /><br />Now I've read of a new version, and they have done a very good job, it's not a minimalist browser by any means, feeds, photos, youtube, blogs, news, all at the screen at the same time it's somewhat overwhelming, but if you get used to it , very powerful.<br /><br />There are sites that you only visit for specific actions ( delicious, blogger,  digg,  flicker, youtube )<br />and you can just let this browser handle the interface and do it all without leaving your current page.<br /><br /><img alt="" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1169/823192164_a3915495f9_o.jpg" style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center;" title="Flock 0.9" /><br /><br />If you think about it , if every site had RSS or a standard API, there are no need to visit them at all, I know that's taking it to a extreme, but  I kind of like what flock does with photos and blog publishing, ( not so much with feeds and news).<br /><br />Anyway, it's good to know that they are still around and they are improving their product, the browser engine is based on Firefox so there is not much difference except in what they add in terms of integration with online services, which is a lot.<br /><p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px;">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p>
