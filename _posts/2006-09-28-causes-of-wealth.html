When I read Adam Smith 's  "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wealth-Nations-Modern-Library/dp/0679424733/sr=8-4/qid=1159454474/ref=pd_bbs_4/102-6935326-4604136?ie=UTF8&s=books">Inquire into the nature and causes of the wealth of the nations</a>", ( and YES I read it entirely , :-) )  ; a lot of things caught my attention: First is that human specialization , is at the core of wealth creation, second, Smith talk about individuals a lot , but the conclusions apply to the society wealth ( that is aggregate  wealth, one person well being depend a lot on himself ), and finally that in the absence of everything else ( specialization, trade, incentives) poverty is what men have.<br /><br />Today I found on my blog readings again the <a href="http://cafehayek.typepad.com/hayek/2006/09/smith_and_marsh.html">same point at cafe hayek</a> (thanks professor )<br /><br />It still amazes me how little we have progressed since the 18th century...<br /><br />There is a lot of talk nowadays about poverty, especially in Latam's populist governments, but some of them are more pragmatic than others, whose economists  should be reading Smith again, because they clearly did not understand ... and the message is in the title , it couldn't be more clear you have to cause wealth, create it : there are no "causes" for poverty there are , however causes for wealth.<br /><br />( If you find Smith too dense you can always start with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0517548232/102-6935326-4604136?ie=UTF8">Hazlitt</a>  or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465081452/102-6935326-4604136?ie=UTF8">Thomas Sowell</a> )
