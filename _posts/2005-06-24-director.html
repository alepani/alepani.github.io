Where do they get this domain names from ?<br /><br />I am a regular user of <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> tags, I even use it with several accounts, for different projects, and have a personal account for my personal interest links.<br />I remember in the "bubble days" ( 1998ish ) there were a lot of this type of services ( bookmarks online), but without the "social" part , I really like to be able to see what's popular, and what other people I know, have linked to. Another example of this is digg.com something similar but more news oriented.<br />That said, the del.icio.us interface sucks :-), luckily somebody made an <a href="http://johnvey.com/features/deliciousdirector/">ajax front end</a> callled direc.tor, it's not perfect, but I can live with it.<br />Via <a href="http://johnvey.com/features/deliciousdirector/">Om</a>
