The good folks at Amazon just released a new Kindle model, the <a bitly="BITLY_PROCESSED" href="http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-DX-Amazons-Wireless-Generation/dp/B0015TCML0/ref=amb_link_84277971_2?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=gateway-center-column&amp;pf_rd_r=042WXP0XTFDW6GCW8T7Z&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=476842251&amp;pf_rd_i=507846">Kindle DX</a>: On paper the concept is good, bigger screen, easier to read. It was designed for newpapers and college textbooks, but primary for newspapers.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a bitly="BITLY_PROCESSED" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_12j-6WCLPuM/SghYkEsgSOI/AAAAAAAAAME/xjVR9xj82SM/s1600-h/kindle.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_12j-6WCLPuM/SghYkEsgSOI/AAAAAAAAAME/xjVR9xj82SM/s320/kindle.jpg" /></a>&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br />But at nearly 500 dollars for a 9.7 inch display is a lot of money for reading newspapers...<br /><br />Sony sells two models one "regular" at 299, and one touchscreen with annotations and led lights at 349. And&nbsp; is rumored to be launching a big screen model soon.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><a bitly="BITLY_PROCESSED" href="http://www.sonystyle.com/wcsstore/SonyStyleStorefrontAssetStore/img/718x407/PRS700BC.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="237" src="http://www.sonystyle.com/wcsstore/SonyStyleStorefrontAssetStore/img/718x407/PRS700BC.png" width="420" /></a></div><br />I actually prefer the smaller size, I use blogs for news, I'm ok with the PRS 505 or Kindle2 Size for books ( maybe an inch bigger, but the kidleDX , is too big) .<br /><br />The problem, and the reason for this is the newspaper business, it is in <b>big</b> trouble, so much in fact that they are getting <a bitly="BITLY_PROCESSED" href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/05/07/amazon-takes-70-percent-of-kindle-newspaper-revenues/">Amazon take a 70% cut</a> on the subscriptions for the Kindle. That's a lot.<br /><br />Major newspapers are losing more and more readers, with <a bitly="BITLY_PROCESSED" href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/US-newspaper-circulation-sees-apf-15039695.html?.v=6">the biggest loss this past year</a>, even <a bitly="BITLY_PROCESSED" href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/media/2006-05-08-newspaper-circulation_x.htm">they are saying this</a>, <br /><br />The music industry fought against digitalization &amp; digital distribution: first Napster, then Gnutella, Emule, Bittorrent, finally they are kind of seeing the light and selling no-DRMd MP3 all over iTunes, Amazon, and other places.<br /><br />Movies went next, fought much less and decided to do the same. Finally TV took the matter into it's own hands&nbsp; and started services like Hulu , FoxOnDemand, and also selling old series on iTunes.<br /><br />&nbsp; The Book business is going to do Ok with Ebooks, <a bitly="BITLY_PROCESSED" href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2009/02/25/10-reasons-to-buy-a-kindle-2-and-10-reasons-not-to/">still people doubt that it will completely replace books</a>. But I think long therm they will as I said in previous posts<br /><br />But for&nbsp; newspapers this&nbsp; really different, they don't actually have content worth paying anymore: There business models are gone: classified ads model is on Craiglist, an Ebay, Advertising has gon to Blogs and Google, and the journalists can do better in a blog where high specialized content is better than anything you can read in a general newspaper. And the ditribution model is from the 19th century.<br /><br />&nbsp; So, I agree with those who say that this is too late, and <a bitly="BITLY_PROCESSED" href="http://gigaom.com/2009/05/04/why-the-kindle-hd-cant-save-newspapers/">they can't save the business</a>. This is desperation.<br />&nbsp; They are desperate, and right to be so, so unless they can get com GM style rescue plan, they will be gone.
