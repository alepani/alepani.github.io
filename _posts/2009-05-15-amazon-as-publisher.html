This could be big: <a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6658267.html">Amazon as a Publisher</a>. Also reported <a href="http://futurismic.com/2009/05/14/amateur-hour-is-over-amazon-becomes-a-publisher/">here</a>.<br /> <br />It had to happen sooner or later, it´s surprising but not unexpected if that makes any sense...Amazon has acquired the rights to the first of possible many novels and cut yet another link in the publisher chain...Could potentially be a big year for the book industry and not in a good way for some folks.<br /><br />In a post "<a href="http://www.blackplasticglasses.com/2009/03/30/why-ebooks-must-fail/">Why Ebooks must fail</a>" Evan Schnittman explains the effect on the industry:<br /><blockquote><em>And therein lies the dilemma… how does the publishing industry fund the creation, editing, design, production, marketing, e-warehousing, and sales of ebooks, if the income isn’t there? How do ebooks cover the huge advances needed to buy books if we cannot generate the cash, especially at their extremely low, discounted prices, cover the advances that an entire industry has come to require? The answer is that ebooks, alone, cannot.</em></blockquote><p> It's a very special point of view, of course, to me the answer is , you don't : As in you don't fund creation and editing, you do marketing at your own risk (not only when you have a bestseller), you don't do the huge advances "the industry expects", because they are unrealistic.</p><p>There are also cost savings: No printing, no  distribution, No warehouses ( e-warehousing ? seriously ? ) . . and you can pre-sell an ebook, with extra content same thing that DVDs does today with special editions. </p><p>The model must cahange,  and Amazon is doing that for them.<br /></p><br /><br /><blockquote> </blockquote>
