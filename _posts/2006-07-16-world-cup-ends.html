Italy gets the trophy for the fourth time, in penalitys.<br />The  comments are all over, I'm not saying anything abouth <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBaBrcBLbqw">Zidane's behaviour</a> or Materazzi 's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVFMuY1CjSE">long</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJPKM5aJGW8">history</a>  in calccio ...<br /><br />Anyway most part of the game sucked, I hope next cups turns out more dynamic and offensive gameplay, because the last two were too defensive and the games and scoring were lowest than usual.
