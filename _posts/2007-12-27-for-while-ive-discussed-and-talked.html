For a while I've discussed and talked about <a href="http://alepanizza.blogspot.com/2005/07/digital-distribution-of-media.html">digital distribution of media</a>, but at the end of 2007, the doom of physical formats, seems inevitable and music will be first.<br /><a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/store/">  Apple</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/MP3-Music-Download/b/ref=sa_menu_dmusic1?ie=UTF8&amp;node=163856011&amp;pf_rd_p=328655101&amp;pf_rd_s=left-nav-1&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_i=507846&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_r=1ZNYZ9AXEY95EVX7W80K">Amazon</a> are selling DRM-free music for several month now, no word on sales , but I am willing to bet that the format switch increased sales.<br /><br />Amazon has announced a deal with Universal to sell their entire music catalog DRM free , and that's a lot of songs....<br /><br />In other recent developments, several bands have taken it one step further :<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_12j-6WCLPuM/R3RelFr0IbI/AAAAAAAAADg/4k96OpEEGpE/s1600-h/radio.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 209px; height: 169px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_12j-6WCLPuM/R3RelFr0IbI/AAAAAAAAADg/4k96OpEEGpE/s320/radio.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5148844265265439154" border="0" /></a><br /><a href="http://www.inrainbows.com/">Radiohead</a>, have released ( or pre-released)  their music for free online before the physical CD.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.nin.com/uploaded_images/still-751290.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 183px; height: 164px;" src="http://www.nin.com/uploaded_images/still-751290.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/store/">Nine Inch Nails</a> has the digital edition of his latest abum online, and uses youtube to post music videos, besides encouraging fans to remix and upload their  songs  <a href="http://www.google.com.uy/search?hl=es&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=B9O&amp;q=release+album+for+free+on+internet&amp;btnG=Buscar&amp;meta=">many bands are following</a>. Even new bands in Uruguay are releasing singles online like "Closet" see <a href="http://www.closet.com.uy/"> here</a>.<br /><br />And the thing is that for big groups the money for album sales is not the biggest income: between production, distribution, publicity , etc.<br />They can however make money by touring, and that can't be copied...<br /><br />For unknown bands, the same is true but, for different reasons, when I can get any music, the best publicity is the song being distributed worldwide for free, that can lead to a record deal or a concert offer.<br /><br />In essence my question is "music" as in "the music business" still an<a href="http://209.85.165.104/search?q=cache:O5Z1VnBN1SEJ:www.fooledbyrandomness.com/brown-q.pdf+taleb+scalable+profession&amp;hl=es&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=6&amp;gl=uy&amp;client=firefox-a"> scalable profession</a>, or has gone back to the non scalable state it was before recording was invented?
