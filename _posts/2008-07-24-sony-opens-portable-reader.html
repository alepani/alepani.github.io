In a <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080724/ap_on_hi_te/tec_sony_reader">recent news release</a> Sony (SNE) announced that the PRS-505 portable reader will be getting a firmware patch that will allow the device to read .epub and .pub files ( same used for adobe ebook reader )  included in de Open Publication Standard and <a href="http://www.ereads.com/2007/09/open-publication-standard-for-e-books.html">backed by open by the IDPF</a>.<br /><br />  This will let Sony get a lot of new books from different vendors and stores, and will hurt the kindle wich has currently more selection and relies on book sales  to profit from the device.<br /> Sony will keep the book store , but my guess is they are gaining money from the hardware already , and do not want another "Playstation business" with the books.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.sonystyle.com/wcsstore/SonyStyleStorefrontAssetStore/img/195x128/PRS505LC.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 226px; height: 149px;" src="http://www.sonystyle.com/wcsstore/SonyStyleStorefrontAssetStore/img/195x128/PRS505LC.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /> I've had the reader for about a year now , and frankly I'm quite happy , book prices are on par with the kindle and the selection is ok, the only weak point is technical books (programming, science, math), wich are almost non-existant  maybe this move will get more content and better prices , good news.
