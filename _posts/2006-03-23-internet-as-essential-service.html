How much do you take the net for granted ?<br />Isn't internet access free everywhere ? no ? What ??<br /><br /><p>While I was in vacation,  I did'nt have net access for 15 days, so I had to resort to dialup for email and news, and give up on downloads and podcast-listening. <br /></p><p>One of the things that frequently happened, was that I left the browser open after disconnecting and the next day reading the storys on the blogs or new I will click on a link and then realize I wasn't connected , then had to resist the urge to go to the pathetic phone line's 40 kbps connection, I kept on reading only to have the same thing happen 2 or three times as I read the news.<br /></p><p>A similar thing hppened while working on a piece of code outside the house, I will check for a sample snippet or help on a particular topic lounch google and to my surprise it diddn't work ( it was no surprising since I have no wifi and no internet here...)</p>All this  got me thinking how much we assume things and how quickly we ( humans) get used to a set of given tools or amenities, or food, or jobs or medical services, and we protest in anger when we don't have it... forgeting that their where nonexisting years ago or in the case of broadband just a couple of years or less<br /><br /><em>Also what a great inconveninece it is not to have net access</em><br /><br /><p>Internet access is being asimilated into the same set as water/electricity/heat/cable TV/cellphone service  ( I would argue that ou can live without cable TV but not without net acccess). <br /></p><p>That is a good thing because more people will demand a good service in any country at hotels/resorts/rented houses etc but has a bad side , the temptation by small governments to assimilate the net into the telcos monopoly, regulate their use, etc, you know to give "universal access" to the information and yadda yadda yadda.....</p><br /><br />
