Google is about to deploy a <a href="http://gigaom.com/2005/08/14/get-ready-for-googlenet/">Wireless network all over the US</a><br /><br />Google will launch <a href="http://gigaom.com/2005/08/14/google-making-a-music-move/">a music download service</a> that will compete and/or partner with Apple's iTunes Store<br /><br />If these seems unlikely remember taht Gmail was once thought to be an april's fool joke , and nobody saw Google maps , Google Earth, etc coming until MS started to play catch up.<br /><br />All news via <a href="http://gigaom.com/">Om Malik</a><br />Interesting times indeed....
