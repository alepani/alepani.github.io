In a recen post,  Paul Graham explains <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/microsoft.html">here</a> , why he thinks Microsoft is dead;<br /><br />I personally think is not quite there yet, but is is slowly becoming irrelevant. When people don't even <i>remember</i> why they should respect or <i>believe</i> that someone should fear your company, you should think about a new strategy....<br /><br />There is not a single fact that has caused the slow fall at Redmond, and it IS slow, mind you, they are still filling trucks of cash with MSOffice and Windows OEM sales, but hey, IBM is still selling iSeries :-)<br /><br />Causality is as complex in business as it is in science, but you start to notice some things....<br /><br />1)  Vista is unquestionable, a failure, a BIG one -given the money invested- , and nobody gives a damn about Windows 7 or IE 8<br /><br />2) They lost the smartphone market , forever !<br /><br />Several years ago - back when Windows Mobile was still being called "Windows CE Smartphone edition"  -  I though and said, that Palm ( then the leading edge of smart portable OSes )  was dead , Nokia still had not produced any smartphone worth using and blackberry was a niche market, surely  the future of phones was Windows : It was easy to use ( Ha ) , you can program in VB or C++ ( starting to see the C# possibility ) , A smal embedded database and office integration, plus a very reduced but usable pocket IE was the best at the time....<br /><br />Just one small problem: more than six  years later, in 2009, we have the best selling Smartphone coming from Apple, Blackberry is revamped and has new models and an upgraded OS, and on top of that  Google launched the open source Android based phones, meanwhile Microsoft counter offer : the same, they had done NOTHING new to the interface, the os or the programming model. a real shame. Sill waiting for WinMo 7 , but not holding my breadth.<br /><br />3) The console market.<br />     To be fair MS is doing better than Sony in the US , that also does not necessary means doing well :-(<br />     The first console, lost money and was  abandoned fast. The second one has been in the market since 2005 and still , in spite of good sales and great Games ( and a lot of Online subscribers) is plagued by hardware errors, network failures and loses money by the millions...<br />   Meanwhile Nintendo profits are in the Billions.<br /><br />4) Search: Google is an advertizing agency based on search.<br />                 Microsoft is a Sofware company, makes money on licencing and subscriptions.<br /><br />The moment you forget that , you start to see things that are not there....<br />Microsoft has no search , never had, their technology for search is bad. They should had focus on making the Windows Explorer local Search work instead of making two search engines and not one good... Hope they don't buy Yahoo. Focus people.<br /><br />5) Real competition, there is that too.<br /><br />     Microsoft has lost the majority of the server market to Linux and BSD and will lose even more as people start to see more mature Linux tools and Microsoft server cost will matter more in a down economy. You can host a web site with half the hardware cost and zero software cost using Open source software.<br /><br />   Netbooks and the Mac .<br />   In the Low end netbooks are selling very well, some of them run XP others run Linux, not one Runs Vista.<br />   In the high end people are switching to MacBooks,  maybe there is no logic reason , but it is a fact, and the number is still small , so it can be higher, as Apple profits are , compared to other notebook makers   :-)<br />  Anecdotal evidence tells me that there is a bit of both, coolness factor, and "just works" usability,<br />  High end Mac Books  are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/pc/565108/ref=pd_ts_pc_nav">at the top this christmas at Amazon</a> and  are the only laptops in the top 25 above 1K ( some of them even over 2K ) and people are not paying 1000 dollar premiums to run Vista.<br /><br /><br />All of the above would be enough to bring down any company, but Microsoft is not "any company", they are smart , resourceful, they know how to succeed and have the money to do it.<br /><br />The problem seems to be that The thing coming out of the pipe are not the right solution, I don't feel excited for the new Windows, or for the -literally- dozens of development technologies coming out of the PDC.  Oslo, M,  Quadrant, Midori ? , the  " Cloud " storage (Live), the new SQLServer , new Biztalk Server... etc<br /><br />The main problem for me is that they made and ambitious and bold move with .NET and didn't quite made the step ( be it bad luck, lack of vision, I don't know, but they didn't ) so they got stuck with old stuff to mantain and support ( XP, Win32 ) and new stuff to evolve and promote ( .NET , Vista, Windows 7 ) .<br />Developers went away.<br /><br />The ease of use, clarity of message  of the usual MS solutions is lost.<br /><br />This is not an anti MS post, I really think they had unique technology, and can still come up with good things, and I hope they do. But I'm not holding my breath<br /><br />PS: If you have not read Graham excellent<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596006624?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=alepanizzablo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0596006624"> Hackers and Painters</a><img alt="" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=alepanizzablo-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0596006624" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important;" border="0" height="1" width="1" />, do it.
