Big news today, as expected, Steve Jobs announced that Apple is "switching" :-) over to Intel chips. The main reason is getting higher perfomance (3Ghz and up) , and cooler processors, for their new Powerbooks, something that IBM's PowerPC chips had failed to deliver.<br /><br />This was reported first in <a href="http://news.com.com/Apple+shakes+hands+with+Intel/2009-1006_3-5733319.html?tag=cnetfd.sd">CNet</a>( I think) and blogged everywhere.<br />I like <a href="http://gigaom.com/2005/06/04/steve-jobs-like-howard-hughes-mystifies/">Om's take</a> on the issue . More <a href="http://business2.blogs.com/business2blog/2005/06/intapp_the_new_.html">here</a><br /><br />What is more surprising to me, though is that: <br /><br />a)They had an up-to-date x86 build of Mac OSX running for the last five years "just in case" ,  (I could have used that )<br /><br />b) Wolfram Research's Mathematica ( this is <span style="font-style:italic;">very </span>complex software if you hadn't used it), was ported in just 2 <span style="font-style:italic;">hours</span>.<br /><br />Will this mean that you could be able to run OsX in any Intel based PC ? Absolutely not. Apple business is 50% hardware .<br />Will you be able tu run windows in a future Apple x86 based PC , I hope so. That would be neat.
