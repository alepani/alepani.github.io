Convergence.<br />I hear and read this word many times  and I'll bet you too.<br />I had a ongoing discussion  with a friend of mine about this, and he thinks that, eventually, the day will come when we all will have the <span style="font-style: italic;">one true device</span> that will let us make phone calls, browse the net, take 8 megapixel shots with optical zoom, shoot HD movies, play all music and video formats,  play killer video games and of course fit in a shirt pocket.<br /><br />I am an optimist, I believe in the power of technology to make life better, not just for gadgets lovers , but for everyone ...but I think world peace is a more realistic goal...<br /><br />Behold CES 2006: apart from the ( now ubiquous) cameraphone, there is no really new device integration at all, instead what we're seeing, and probably continue to see is specialization and new class of devices.<br /><br />Exibith A : The most successful CE device of the last 10 years :the iPod is "Just a music player" , No  web, no phone, no camera, not even radio....it's the best out there .<br /><br />New products at CES highlit specialization : GPS for runnners (Garmin) check, Programmable robots for kids check ( LEGO, Robosapiens), Ebook Readers ( no color, no wifi, no writing) just a good reader check (Sony, Phillips).  NOKIA tablet Web browsing device ( no keyboard, no LAN,no expansion, no HD) check,  High Def camcorders check ( Mpeg4, 5.1 sound , HD or DVD recodring ) no wifi, no phone, just cameras, bigger and better HDTVs, portable players with hard disk but no phone..and the list goes on ...<br /><br />Why is this happening ? Is it a conspiracy ? We all want this super-device-do-it-all don't we ?<br />Well actually no.<br /><br />The average cellphone user don't care for a camera, will use it, and will prefere a Good ( 2 megapixel ) cameraphone over no camera, but cost is a factor ,size is a factor ,and if he has to carry another camera for the good pictures, the utility is gone.<br /><br />The same for "walkman phones" the have to sound better and have a much better UI to be even considered as primary music players W800 and w810 are the closest out there and their PC interface SUCKS.<br /><br />Don't talk to me about video, Nokia and sony have the best Video multipurpose devices. Still/Video cameras and Cameraphones, who make fantastic phone calls OR take 5 megapixel stills and Shaky crappy compressed video.<br />In 5 years the average (western) TV will have 720p or 1080p resolution, no one in his right mind will watch a 320 x 240 compressed family video........<br />My next video camera will be HD and not a phone, I am sure of that.<br /><br />We all want ( and we 'll get) :<br /><ul><li> HD Sony Handycams with 5.1 audio ( recording to HD, Flash or BD Disks)  </li><li> Canon Rebel Dgicams wit 15 shots per secons killer opticals with stabilization and wireless interface with flickr</li><li> Motorola and nokia phone with music, decent cams (maybe GPS and decent news readers)</li><li> WristWatch GPS'd PDAs that control our exercice routine and appointments ( maybe they could talk to the cellphone)  and give us directions</li></ul><br />None of this devices will make a good music player except maybe the cellphone but has a long way to go.<br /><br />Some use cases always make the point clear.....<br /><br />If I want to go running early in the morning, maybe I want to carry my cellphone, maybe not, sure I don't want a camera, maybe I want to listen some music, then again maybe not.<br />Suppose my taste is running with no music but I want to log my jog with a gps enabled device...<br /><br />If I just  woke up and  I want to have breakfast while reading the news. can do it in a laptop or in the cellphone, or an Ebook reader.. which one I choose to tead on the table ? and in the bed ?<br /><br /><br />I will go to my son birthday/graduation etc. Can I carry my 2 3, 5 megapixel cameraphone o I will use my 10 magapixel SLR with image stabilization and manual control lens , what if the flash is not enough, the response time not enough, sensitivity ? ,  what If i get  aphone call in the middle of a photo....?<br /><br />Bottom line: Convergence will slowly happen , but I will bet that in 10 years time, ( that's an eternity) , we still will have music player, phones, game consoles, and specialized video and photo recording devices  , maybe even iPods ( but they'll could have FM )<br /><br /><br />
