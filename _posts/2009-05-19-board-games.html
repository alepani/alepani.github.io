I bought <a bitly="BITLY_PROCESSED" href="http://www.wired.com/print/gaming/gamingreviews/magazine/17-04/mf_settlers">Settlers of Catan</a> for the kids last year, and we've been ejoying a lot since.<br />Both of my sons prefer playing Settlers over TV and somedays even over Videogames, which is quite an achievement. Plus the game is also entertainig for older kids and adults , so , unlike most board games I can actually play with them. (via <a bitly="BITLY_PROCESSED" href="http://wired.com/">Wired.com</a>)
