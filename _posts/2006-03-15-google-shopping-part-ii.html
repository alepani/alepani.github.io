Yes I am writing this post in <a title="writely" href="http://www.writely.com/">writely</a>  . :-)<br /><p>Google has it's word processor now. And it's not Word, but it works and most important it's free...</p><p>I 'm sure it will get better and integrated into the "google pack" .<br /></p><p>There is a lot of ajax-based word processors but only one is part of goog and thus it gets instant credibility as the one to use.</p><p>So now you will see search in your documents online and offline , mails, chat and soon calendar.<br /></p><p>I am missing excel and access. this could be a severe hit to MS over the long term because it's attacking it's main revenue source.</p><p>Google made another buyout with <a title="sketchup" href="http://www.sketchup.com/">sketchup</a> (report via <a title="OM Malik" href="http://gigaom.com/2006/03/14/google-buys-sketchup/">OM Malik</a>) a 3D software /modeling  software ( non web ) sort of "basic autoCAD"</p><p><br /></p>
