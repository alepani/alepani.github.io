Amazon launched today the Kindle eBook reader. Very similar to the Sony's offering, but some things are better, others... not so much.<br /><br />I've had the <a href="http://www.sonystyle.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10551&amp;storeId=10151&amp;langId=-1&amp;productId=8198552921665245740">Sony PRS-505</a> for a month now, and I really like it, especially when it comes to reading fiction in native format, ( format conversion is hit or miss , especially with PDF).<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.sonystyle.com/wcsstore/SonyStyleStorefrontAssetStore/img/195x128/PRS505LC.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 229px; height: 150px;" src="http://www.sonystyle.com/wcsstore/SonyStyleStorefrontAssetStore/img/195x128/PRS505LC.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>The <a href="http://amazon.com/gp/product/B000FI73MA/ref=amb_link_5873612_3?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=gateway-center-column&amp;pf_rd_r=15YDP91CRV2ZP20NFM9A&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=329252801&amp;pf_rd_i=507846">Amazon Kindle</a> ( see the link in the adds :-)  ),  uses the exact same display technology ( eInk ) which is awesome tech for reading books outdoors, but the Kindle does not connect to a computer, instead, it uses Sprint EV-DO network (called Whispernet) for accessing the Amazon/Kindle store, you can also access  Wikipedia (yay !) and update your subscriptions. ( there are no connection fees, so in essence, Amazon is paying your internet bill hoping that you will buy enough books) .<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/digital/fiona/dp/v3-whispernet._V4948240_.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 200px;" src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/digital/fiona/dp/v3-whispernet._V4948240_.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />Other niceties : since you have to purchase books from the device, it has a keyboard and a selection wheel, which allows search and annotation in the books. It makes the device bigger and heavier and the connection eats up the amazing eInk battery life, but it's a nice feature.<br /><br />A couple of things I did not get:<br /><br />Books are cheaper than Sony connect store, ( 9.99 the average price  are they still getting money after paying for EVDO ?) , probably not that's why they charge you for <span style="font-style: italic;">reading blogs</span> , yes that's correct amazon<span style="font-weight: bold;"> charges</span> you for reading "select blogs" ( they have to be formatted for the device)  ;  at least Sony Connect blogs ( which offers less than 20 blogs out of millions )  are free.<br />Why EV-DO this limit's the device to the U.S. and only the U.S. and not WiFi ? which you can get in hotels everywhere for free ?<br /><br />All in all the devices are functionally equivalent on the reading part, Amazon wireless connectivity helps you if you want to buy a book in a hurry, (  I don't see myself reading blogs in either the Kindle or the Sony, much less browsing, the refresh is too slow and the controls are tuned to linear reading...) , but it kills you if you are outside of Sprint coverage, say Europe, or China.<br /><br />In conclusion, I think is great that Amazon jumped into  digital,  I really hope the hardware would work worldwide, but it doesn't.  Anyway the books are  very aggressively priced and has a  big selection  (80,000  at least plus magazines and newspapers ) . This will force Sony to wide it's selection and correct the pricing if it wants to stay in the game.<br /><br />For now , if you travel, read PDFs, or live outside the US , The Sony PRS-505 is the   only choice. If you live and work in the US, you have the Kindle/Amazon option... It's at least 100 dollars more but the lower price of books and the connectivity can justify it. Shame it does not have Wifi.....both have to improve a lot to be the "iPod of books"<br /><br />Update  20/11/07  : Of course the Kidle <span style="font-style: italic;">works</span> outside the US,  you just can't connect to Whispernet, ( so you can't purchase books, receive the news or blogs , or use wikipedia ), so it's functionality is very limited.
