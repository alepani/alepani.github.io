Google has released another of it's famous, "beta" applications, a web based <a href="http://spreadsheet.google.com/">spreasheet</a><br />it's fairly complete, except that has no macro support ( thanks god!) and no graphics.<br />Is google  trying to slowly build an office suite, or just to force MS to freeze the file format first ?<br /><br />Now, let's recap a bit, Gmail, Writely, Google Base (with API), Calendar, search (online and offline), Chat, and Spreadsheet, they are just missing a good presentation/graphic package and there is no reason for the average (say 80% )   of the users to buy or install an office suite, with the added bonus that is available everywhere , cost free, and install free.<br /><br />Is is posible or desirable for google to develop/buy into a usable online presentation package.<br />If you check the latest version of Office 12 beta, you can say it's a tough one. Powerpoint is one of the most computer intensive apps in office and the new version is incredible easy to use and can produce stunning results in minutes.<br /><br />My personal opinion, ( not shared with the majority of people who I have discussions with) is that it will inevitable happen ( Google presenter or whatever they decide to call it) but it should be a couple of years yet  before the kind of bandwith / processing needed to do a DHTML/AJAX  version of Powerpoint with decent performance are available....
