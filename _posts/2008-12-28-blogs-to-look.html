During the last months of 2008, one of my favorites blogs is <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/">Overcoming bias</a>. Not all authors are equally good but is it a challenging read every time, and leaves you asking more questions , which is a good thing.<br /><br />Recently , has a series of post discussing things like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_Artificial_Intelligence">friendly AI</a>, conscience, free will , and autonomy in AI , not for everybody , but if you are into that sort of thing , interesting stuff:<br /><br /> <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/12/unpersons.html#more">Nonsentient Optimizers</a>.<br /><br /> <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/12/model-citizens.html">Nonperson Predicates</a>.<br /><br /> have fun :-)<br /><br />Not related, but useful and funny:  <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/12/quotes-20.html">Rationality Quotes</a>.
