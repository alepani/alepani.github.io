It's been a while since I posted about books. I would say  I'd probably spend most of my time reading, ( well maybe onine, but I do read a lot).<br /><br />My kids are starting to pick the habit, and I think there is a small gap between kids books ( a lot of drawings , few words),  and the likes of Harry Potter ( hundreds of pages and not a single drawing).<br /><br />Kids will fill this naturally in one way or another , but I often find that short stories ( especially fantasy) is one of them, the classic short novels are sometimes adapted for old kids in a condensed version with drawings ( R.L Stevenson, and Emilio Salgari were my favorites when I was a kid ) and the final and more fun : comics books . Not any comic will do here you mus familiarize with the genius of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Goscinny">Rene√© Goscinny</a> , his work is interesting, good,  story and full of sunny historical (and other) references.   I especially recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=asterix&amp;x=0&amp;y=0">Asterix</a> and   <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=tintin&amp;x=0&amp;y=0">The Adventures of TinTin</a>  as the pinnacle of this kind of comic/novel, with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=lucky+luke&amp;x=0&amp;y=0">Lucky Luke series</a> close behind.  I don't know a single person that has read those as a kid that don't have their own collection...<br /><br />Important:  Avoid the latest Asterix books as they are not written by the great <span class="ptBrand"> Goscinny they should have never been published....a shame.<br /><br /></span><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f0/Asterix_-_Cast.png/800px-Asterix_-_Cast.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 315px; height: 221px;" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f0/Asterix_-_Cast.png/800px-Asterix_-_Cast.png" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><span class="ptBrand"><br /></span>
