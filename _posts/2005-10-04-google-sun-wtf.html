The recently announced <a href="http://news.com.com/Sun+moves+into+Google+orbit/2009-1012_3-5888474.html?tag=nefd.lede">Google/Sun partnership</a> has left me perplexed.<br />I understand what's Sun advantage on this, they just got the biggest Openoffice and Java storefront they could possible have, and being associated with the hottest company in tech isn't bad publicity at all.<br />But Google?, If they wanted an office package, they can make one ( although I don't see the need for that:<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx"> big desktop apps</a> are dinosaurs that a future oriented company like Google shoudn't be even considering), and they can't be seriously considering writing java apps themselves.<br />Unless I am misssing something that Sun can offer Google other than overpriced servers and slow VMs...
