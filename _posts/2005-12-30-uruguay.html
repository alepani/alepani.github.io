This week had several mentions of Uruguay in the news and around the web.<br /><ul><li>Argentinians ( some of them ) <a href="http://www.mercopress.com/Detalle.asp?NUM=6938">are up in protests</a> against the constructions of two pulp mills form Finland and Spanish investors , these are by far the largest foreign private investment in the country and its estimated that they  will create at least 10,000 jobs or more in the first years. "Enviromentalist" protesters believe ( <a href="http://www.thebusinessonline.com/DJStory.aspx?DJStoryID=20051226DN001682">in spite of evidence on the contrary</a>) that the plants will cause some sort of pollution.  Apparently the plants will not cause any harm if installed on the <a href="http://bustismos.blogspirit.com/la_condena_del_pasado/">other side of the river</a> :-)</li></ul><ul><li>Tyler Cowen of <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/">marginal revolution</a> is in Buenos Aires and he <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2005/12/pedro_figari.html">likes Pedro Figari</a><br /> Tyler wonders about Uruguay's black people . The estimate is that blacks or people with black ancester's account for between 10 and 15 percent of the population. They are  here, but most of them , relegated to lower socio-economic groups. <br /></li></ul><ul> <li>On a more positive note , Dan Halpern of Food &amp; Wine  magazine was in Punta del Este (my favorite place in the world) and just <a href="http://www.foodandwine.com/articles/south-americas-riviera">discovered the chivito  </a>( way to go Dan ! )</li></ul><br />
