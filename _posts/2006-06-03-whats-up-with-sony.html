First, a disclaimer,  I am a Sony "fan" ; I truly love sony's products, I have a PS2 and lots of games, ( had a PS)  I also have a Sony  digital sill camera and a Sony Handycam for family videos and photos. In fact if money were no object,  I will own every Sony product.<br /><br />I have to say though, that lately, the company has made several mistakes and several of their most interesting products have been announced for months, and yet, they are almost always late or no shipping date announced. I knid of like apple style of announcing a product and shipping the next day. ;-)<br /><br />Last year was the Sony DRM/Malware in their audio CDs, they denied, apologized, issued a patch and retired the CDs. Then the Blu-ray disc "demo" that was running from a regular DVD-R was covered everywhere. And finally their E3/PS3 un-conference that bored everyone and announced the highest priced console yet.<br /><br />As for the products themselves:<br />BluRay movies and player: delayed until at least August'06 . The competitor  HD-DVDs already on the market at half the price.<br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Update :  Samsung released BD player , but Sony Player got delayed again.</span><br /><br />Sony Reader (eInk) announced at CES in January, originally to be released in february-march, then spring, now delayed until late summer. No mention of price of content or content availability.<br /><br />PS3 : Six months late, 200 dollars too expensive, originally to have two video outs, now only one, low-end model without Card reader, Wifi or Digital output<br /><br />Digital cameras: Sony purchased the Konica-Minolta division and is working in a digital SLR. Highend models (R1) cannot compete with Nikon and Canon they need a high end dSLR camera. No release date, features or price announced on the site , ony "interviews" with the executives in charge.<br /><br />To be fair with Sony, their Cybershot digital cameras are indeed good ones, their video cameras are the best in every category. The Playstation 3 is probably the most powerful and featured of the next-gen hardware offers and the Sony Reader if nothing else will be an innovative new product.<br />The only question is why another format war on video? Who needs Blu Ray or HD when digital distribution is already going to take over....?<br /><br />PS: I <strong>will</strong> buy a PS3, just maybe not at launch.
