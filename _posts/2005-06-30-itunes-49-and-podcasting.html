iTunes 4.9 is <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes">out</a>, it includes podcasts, meaning that you can subscribe to podcasts from iTunes and it will retrieve new episodes more or less automatically. <br />I tried the Windows version, I like the directory and the fact that I can see all the shows and filter them, in the same way as the songs. Still I have some minor issues with filtering and download retriying that do not work as I expected.<br />I' sticking with <a href="http://ipodder.sourceforge.net/">iPodder (Lemon)</a> for now, but I eventually go with iTunes. <br />( My wife's finally getting a shuffle and the synchronization in iTunes is the best out there).<br />Anyway Apple is still ahead of the rest in digital content delivery (I'm waiting for the movies Steve! ), and with the new iPods and the rumored iPod phone coming out it's positioned to dominate the digital device market.
