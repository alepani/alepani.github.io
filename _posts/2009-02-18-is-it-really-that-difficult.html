<div align="left">Don't get me wrong , I have an iPhone, and I really like it, I've never cared much about cellphones, except as development platforms. But I am really starting to depend it for more things: from organizing, mail, notes, backup, to web surfing, and multimedia,&nbsp; etc.<br /><br />What strikes me as strange is that still there isn't a much better phone out there, several companies , throwing millions of R&amp;D to fight Apple, and all I see is poor interfaces, lame copy attempts and slow response.<br />Just check the last <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/Mwc2009/">World Mobile Congress</a> (WMC) in &nbsp;beautiful Barcelona, a lot of new android phones , some proprietary interfaces and a <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/02/16/microsoft-announces-windows-mobile-6-5/">glimpse of WinMo 6.5</a> . Not much what I was expecting, nothing exactly new or revolutionary.<br /><br />For example one Samsung touch interface:</div><object align="center" height="302" width="400"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=3250879&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1"><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=3250879&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="400" height="302"></embed></object><br /><div align="left"><br /><a href="http://vimeo.com/3250879">How Not To Do Touch Technology</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/user562128">Gizmodo</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a>.<br /><br /><br />To be fair Microsoft is <a href="http://www.microsoft-watch.com/content/desktop_mobile/windows_mobile_is_still_immobile.html">not doing so much better</a>.... it should kill the Zune and start focusing, and <a href="http://www.microsoft-watch.com/content/desktop_mobile/what_microsoft_should_learn_from_nokia.html">learn from Nokia</a> a couple of things.<br /><br />Nokia and Sony Ericsson are trying different directions ( Better cameras, a different approach to design ) &nbsp;, I like the new Nokia 8 megapixel N86, the N97 interface and store, great GPS interface, and the Sony "Idou" 12 megapixel in a phone, but these are the exceptions... &nbsp; it's a sharp contrast to the HTC, Hyundai, Asus, Acer, etc, and other dozens of Android or Windows mobile devices ( by the way none of this are for sale yet, by the time they came to market , Apple should have the next-gen iPhone on stores... ). LG and others also have some sort of touch interface but having tried the Samsung omnia , and looking at the video above , I am not holding my breath about them.<br /><br />The Palm Pre looks promising, and the android Phones should be worthy of looking into after a couple of OS revisions, but right now , there is not much to choose from.<br /><br />I Just hope someboy gave Apple a real reason to put some more on the iPhone ..<br />or at least to lower the price :-(<br /><br />Update 2/19&nbsp; : Engadget <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/02/18/editorial-ten-reasons-why-windows-mobile-6-5-misses-the-mark/">has a nice analysis of what is wrong</a> with Winmo. </div><br />Update 3/10 :&nbsp; From MS Watch<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Apparently MS version of the Appstore <a href="http://www.microsoft-watch.com/content/developer/windows_mobile_developers_pay_what.html?kc=MWRSS02129TX1K0000535">will charge $99 per application </a>. Yeah , great.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many people will learn Objective C now...<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Microsoft should hire Bozo the clown to run Windows Mobile. At least the antics would be funny." After a pause: "He's dead, by the way."
