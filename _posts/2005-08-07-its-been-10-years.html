I barely remember my first internet experience, compuserve with mosaic, slow, fom a hospital bed, I went to metacrawler, I think, an tried a couple of pages. <br />It was unusable.<br />It was amazing. <br />I just read Wired August issue, <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.08/tech.html">and the story is there</a> , from Ted Nelson's Xanadu project ( yes I'm old enough to have the BYTe article on that too ) , to netscape IPO August 9, 1995, just 10 years ago it all begun. <br />Some fun bits in retrospective: a lot of people thought that the net had potential, most people didn't have a clue, but nobody knew what was coming,I mean nobody, Even the folks at Netscape were afraid that maybe the browser market was saturated, because Mosaic have been downloaded around million times :-) ....<br />In the age of Google Earth, Amazon, Blogs, Mobile browsing, Wifi, Podcasting, and Bittorrent we still don't realize how much the last 10 years had changed the word.<br />Living in 1985 or 1995, was a little bit different,yes , but 2005  it's another f***ing  universe. Think about it.
