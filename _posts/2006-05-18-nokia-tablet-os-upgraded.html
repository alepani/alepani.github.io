<br />When nokia launched de Internet tablet ( Nokia 770 ) , <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/Nokia_770_Internet_Tablet/4505-3127_7-31396042.html">the reviews where not favorable</a>. Apparently the consumers did in fact like it and nokia went out to sell a lot of them.<br />Recently Microsoft and Intel launched the UMPC initiative, essencially a higher size PDA or a jhalf sized tabled, depending on the way you look at it.<br /><br />The comparison is not favorable to the UMPC though:<br /><ul><li> Nokia is selling their tablet with WiFi b/g and Bluetooth, card reader a Linux OS with a custom gui, and an open source SDK, for $350 </li><li> Most UMPCs run a special version of Windows with an on screen keyboard, OS comparison aside the cheapest cost 900 dollars and there are some up to $1500.</li></ul><br />I know the comparison is not completely fair, because the UMPC has a hard drive and 512 mb of RAM, it's essencially a 7 inch notebook with a slow processor and a keyboard, while the nokia is justa PDA ( 192 MB total, and no HD)<br /><br />But both devices are targeted at the same public, can play audio and video , and their primary function , I believe, will be wireless browsing/chatting and email. Not running high end apps and you dont need a notebook for that. <br /><br />Anyway the point is that the Nokia Tablet OS has indeed been upgraded and now includes Google talk ( both text and voice, among other minor interface upgrades)<br /><br />But than again the same situation happened with MS vs palm at the beggining of the PDA race, and we all know what happened then :-(<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
