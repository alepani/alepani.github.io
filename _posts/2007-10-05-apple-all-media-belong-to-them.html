Today Apple stock rose again more than 3% to 161, using "retrospective explanation"  , you might say that the cause was probably,  the rumor that Leopard (a.k.a OS X 10.5)  has a <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2007/10/04/mac-os-x-leopard-on-october-26th/">shipping date in late October</a>, or something like that ( I actually believe the price will be higher once iPhone sales are disclosed) .<br /><br />I mentioned in the previous post the attention to detail that Apple , Inc. puts into every product it makes, <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/10/05.html">here is Joel</a> , clear as always explaining how Apple does what it does and why does it better than the rest.<br /><br />Now what will they go or should go next ?.<br /><br />I think they have music, just own the digital market, period. Amazon is offering DRM free mp3 to compete! this was unthinkable just 6 months ago; this shows how desperate music labels have become... they just realized that if they don't have multiple distribution channels is iTunes and bittorrent ( and it's gonna be hard for them to match bittorrent price).<br /><br />Also, if you want to watch a crash in slow motion, <a href="http://www.hulu.com/">check the TV networks</a> and the movie industry trying to get rid of Cupertino, and watch them fail. The model for the future might as well as be independent films digitally distributed by different channels; What are the studios and label offering now (as in adding value) in a digital world ? nothing.<br /><br />Now people still read books and magazines, this is the last digital frontier, still e-books have not found a way into the mainstream, they remain something only geeks use. The best offer right now is probably the <a href="http://www.infosyncworld.com/news/n/8395.html">Sony Reader</a> : new display technology and reasonable priced hardware and books, although it has a rather small selection in the connect store.<br /><br />Amazon is again <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/10/03/kindle-edition-books-appear-on-amazon-reader-launch-imminent/">getting into the game</a> ( is there anything they don't do? ) with their already established online brand and store, they will offer a hardware dedicated reader ( <a href="http://www.readersread.com/cgi-bin/bookblog.pl?bblog=912061">kindle ebook</a>) and a software one, the books  and reader are pricier than Sony's.<span class="on" style="display: block;" id="formatbar_CreateLink" title="VÃ­nculo" onmouseover="ButtonHoverOn(this);" onmouseout="ButtonHoverOff(this);" onmouseup="" onmousedown="CheckFormatting(event);FormatbarButton('richeditorframe', this, 8);ButtonMouseDown(this);"></span><br />Will AAPL step in ? Well, they might , they have the online presence, software distribution channels and brand...they need two things:<br /><ul><li>   The publishers ( here they need them , but it won't be as hard to convince them since there are many others doing the same, like amazon, they won't be the first ebook store, and they won't have the largest selection . I'm sure Steve can convince them )</li><li>    The hardware...<a href="http://wowio.wordpress.com/2007/09/27/islate-vs-iphone-a-clear-reading-advantage/"> well there is this rumor going around</a> that they have a 200+ dpi 4.75 inch screen flat device like a tablet, that will launch next year, it could be a very good ebook reader.... if they indeed come up with this I'm pretty sure they will enter the ebook business. iLibrary ? iShelf ?</li></ul>
