Yesterday we were able to try one of the new prototypes of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Laptop_per_Child">OLPC</a>, ( commonly referred as de $100 dollar computer), from Nicolas Negroponte's <a href="http://www.laptop.org/">One Laptop Per Child project</a>. ( Uruguay's wiki of "<a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/OLPC_Uruguay">Ceibal project</a>")<br /><br />It'a nice little machine, it looks very solid and rugged.<br />The OS is a custom flavour of linux (XO) and it has wifi mesh networking built in.<br />The camera is surprisingly good in quality and apparently can take videos too.<br /><br />It takes a while to booth but so does my Vista dual core machine :-)<br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/panizza/1422601565/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1127/1422601565_7d715598a9.jpg" alt="DSC00125.JPG" height="375" width="500" /></a><br /> photo by <a href="http://sgomez.blogspot.com">sgomez</a><br /><br /><br />On the software side, The <span style="font-style: italic;">Sugar </span>UI is very simple, The Wi-fi utility list machines nearby and connects automatically.<br />It comes with a word processor, imaging software for the camera, some kind of Logo language, and EToys ( a <a href="http://www.squeakland.org/">squeak environment for programming</a> , I already mentioned) and other small utility software.<br /><br />Overall a it's a nice little system. I hope it serves it purpose ...
