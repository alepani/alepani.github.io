<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://images.apple.com/macosx/features/bonjour/images/indexsafari20050412.gif"></a><br />The real Steve Jobs ( not the <a href="http://fakesteve.blogspot.com/">fake</a> one) was on stage on Apple developer conference, not major announcements, some games for Mac, and some enhacements to the Mac OS.<div><br /><div> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_12j-6WCLPuM/RnKAbMpItvI/AAAAAAAAAAU/jgp4cXCR1Ng/s320/steve.jpg" /></div><div><br /><div>One thing get everybody perplexed, Apple released <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari for Windows</a>, I don't know why they did it, but it was strange, SJ must have his reasons ( he almost always does ) but it's a mistery to me why they still develop Safari for OSx even, and don't just use Firefox as a bundle.</div><div> </div><div>Still it's just a beta, crashes often and does not offer any feature that is that far ahead of the competition, in the way iTunes  does.</div><div><br /></div><div><img src="http://images.apple.com/macosx/features/bonjour/images/indexsafari20050412.gif" /><br /></div><div><br /></div><div> </div><div></div><div> </div><div> </div><div> </div><div> </div><div>There are a couple of reasons why this could make sense: first, let windows users see that the mac browser is not that different and it's better than IE, and second make sure that Web developers try their apps on safari even if they don't have  Macs to do it. On a side note the installation also installs Quicktime and Bonjour ( apple's version of shared  network making any Safari for Windows user into a node in the apple home network).</div><div><br /></div><div> </div><div> </div><div>For now I'm sticking with the old dogma : the simplest explanation is the correct one and for once I'll agree with <a href="http://gigaom.com/2007/06/15/safari-for-windows-but-why/">Om Malik on this one</a> and think that they want to give windows user a try of Mac OS software to convince them to change sides, ( even though if that was the case I would have preferred to get some of the other shiny apple apps like iLife and/or their Keynote presentation software).</div><div><br /></div><div> </div><div> </div><div> </div></div></div>
