It's been a week since I've got my new MacBook Pro, and though I've never used a Mac before; the change is not very traumatic.<br />I like OS X , a lot, I'm not even comparing it to Vista, it's a different thing; some things are a little different, you get used to it; others way better than MS Windows, and you will never want to go back.<br /><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_12j-6WCLPuM/RwG4G3bO1dI/AAAAAAAAACA/7oI9GZohzvY/s1600-h/DSC02974_2.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_12j-6WCLPuM/RwG4G3bO1dI/AAAAAAAAACA/7oI9GZohzvY/s320/DSC02974_2.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5116573079766488530" border="0" /></a><br /><br />I was giving a <a href="http://www.genexus.com/portal/hgxpp001.aspx?2,47,731,O,S,0,MNU;E;160;6;MNU;,">talk last tuesday</a> about design in UI and Interaction design, and the Mac environment is very cohesive and  consistent, some things I had trouble adjusting are the keyboard and the whole file manager : explorer vs. finder , finder has better search: it works as opposed to the windows "Search" in XP, the keyboard , still not convinced....<br /><br />The quality of the hardware is top of the line, some bundled applications, like Mail, Dashboard, iPhoto, etc are really good ,  other are more novelty items. I was, however, very surprised by the number of open source and freeware applications for OSX , Adium(IM) , TunnelBlick (VPN), Skype, Mac the Ripper ( DVD backup) , Transmission ( Bt client), even Microsoft's remote desktop, and Apple's  Bootcamp ( very important because I work in XP so I need dual boot) work very well.<br /><br />So pros:<br /><ul><li>Spotlight</li><li>Uninstall = Trash<br /></li><li>iLife / Automator / Unix<br /></li><li>UI</li><li>Hardware design</li><li>No drivers ! No dlls !<br /></li></ul>cons ?<br /><ul><li>Price</li><li>No NTFS writing ( at least not officially)</li><li>too few USB  ports</li><li>No memory card reader</li><li>You need an external mouse for windows XP</li><li>Awkward keyboard layout ( for a PC user)<br /></li></ul>    Overall the experience is positive, and although I still think the Mac Book is overpriced, is very hard not to get caught admiring Apple's attention to detail, in both hardware and software.
