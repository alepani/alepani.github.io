Way back when Google released their spreadsheet tool and got writely, I <a href="http://alepanizza.blogspot.com/2006/06/google-spreadsheet-is-powerpoint-next.html">wandered in an old post</a> how long it will take for them to release a presentation tool.<br />Turns out it was a year.<br /><br />Over at the <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/04/were-expecting.html">official google blog</a> there is finally announced the acquisition of Tonic System as the base of their Google Presentation tool.<br /><br />The release date is "Summer" ( north ) so it's June or July; this completes the google online collaboration suite that now includes : GMail, Docs, Spreadsheet, GTalk, Calendar, and Notebook.
