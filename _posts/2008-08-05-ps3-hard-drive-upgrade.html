Having a <span style="font-style: italic;">good</span> music and video collection, my trusty old 60 Gb PS3 was at his top capacity; and buying a webcam (PS Eye ), and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sony-98151-SingStar-Bundle/dp/B000R3CIP0/ref=pd_bbs_sr_3?ie=UTF8&amp;s=videogames&amp;qid=1217970204&amp;sr=8-3">Singstar</a>, didn't improve things... So I decided to upgrade; after a bit of research I settled for a new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Western-Digital-Scorpio-Sata-2-5IN/dp/B0011U65F2/ref=pd_bbs_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=electronics&amp;qid=1217964726&amp;sr=8-1">WD 320 GB Scorpio disk</a> ( amazon ).<br /><br />The only important thing to remember is that you need a 2.5'' (notebook) SATA  Hard Drive. The one that comes with the machine is 5400 rpm, so it is best to use the same speed also. I am not aware that there is any limit in the supported capacity of the PS3 drive, but maybe it is.<br />In any case 320 GB is recognized and works.<br /><br />I checked some sites on "how to" and decided it would be really easy :-)<br /><br />First rule  : Backup<br /><br />The PS3 has a backup utility that backs up almost everything: other stuff like usernames and configs and the system software is not in the hard disk .<br />I had to delete some stuff ( I had copies of almost all of it)  to make the backup fit in  my ipod.<br /><br />Remember to turn <span style="font-style: italic;">everything off</span> and unplug the console to avoid problems.<br /><br />Opening the HD door,  It's just removing a plastic panel, no big deal , you can use a flat screwdriver or a knife :-)<br />you get this:<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_12j-6WCLPuM/SJisH-ksOYI/AAAAAAAAAIA/5d4fdA74_PU/s1600-h/Photo-0096.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 195px; height: 198px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_12j-6WCLPuM/SJisH-ksOYI/AAAAAAAAAIA/5d4fdA74_PU/s320/Photo-0096.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5231120220246784386" border="0" /></a><br />That is the hard drive, after removing the center "blue screw"  you pull right, and then out, the metal handle and remove the drive with the metal frame attached.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_12j-6WCLPuM/SJitMceIQBI/AAAAAAAAAII/ouYXxqn-C_I/s1600-h/Photo-0094.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 204px; height: 200px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_12j-6WCLPuM/SJitMceIQBI/AAAAAAAAAII/ouYXxqn-C_I/s320/Photo-0094.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5231121396503429138" border="0" /></a><br /><br />...and removing the hard disk from the frame involves 4 more screws, this are really hard to remove if you don't have the right tools.<br /><br />Metal frame:<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_12j-6WCLPuM/SJivjXyCY9I/AAAAAAAAAIQ/fWjr95yplBc/s1600-h/Photo-0095.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 167px; height: 187px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_12j-6WCLPuM/SJivjXyCY9I/AAAAAAAAAIQ/fWjr95yplBc/s320/Photo-0095.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5231123989405000658" border="0" /></a><br />After you get the metal frame, then is the same steps back in reverse oreder :<br /><br />- Attach the new hard disk to metal frame with the 4 screws<br />- Insert Hard Disk into Playstation and push to the left with handle to snap it in place.<br />- Put blue screw back on , and then the plastic latch<br />- Plug back in and reboot<br /><br />If everything goes ok, it asks to format the new drive ( yes) and after a while reboot again.<br />then restore the backup with Saved Games and other goodies and Done!.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_12j-6WCLPuM/SJjD7YjAp9I/AAAAAAAAAIw/HEiB4t3D7JM/s1600-h/Photo-0094_2.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 238px; height: 317px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_12j-6WCLPuM/SJjD7YjAp9I/AAAAAAAAAIw/HEiB4t3D7JM/s320/Photo-0094_2.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5231146392159823826" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_12j-6WCLPuM/SJi0EZUvoRI/AAAAAAAAAIg/qu5PSbln4Sk/s1600-h/Photo-0094_2.jpg"><br /></a>
