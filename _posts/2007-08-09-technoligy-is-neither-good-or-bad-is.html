Technology is neither good or bad, is agnostic. It's a tool and depends on how you use it.<br />Never have the saying ringed so true.  An array of nuclear missiles can protect the entire human race?<br /><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99942_Apophis">Apophis </a>is the name of an asteroid that according to the estimates could pass very close to the earth by 2029  affecting its orbit, or even impacting the planet, with the possibility that several smaller object  impacting in the next 2 to 5 years.<br /><br />I know this is still in the future, but I have a rare interest in this kind of things, I want the human race to last for some time , call me sentimental :-)  or crazy .<br /><br />Asteroids have been "missing" earth for as long as I can remember, but even a small asteroid impacting earth full on can do more damage than the IRAK war, global warming,  Al-Qaeda and all the diseases in Africa put together.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">I've been wondering how nobody was even working on this, but apparently folks at NASA have been very busy, they had designs and prototypes for orbiting stations, including the last one they proposed with six 1.2 megatons nuclear missiles.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.flightglobal.com/assets/getAsset.aspx?ItemID=18768"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; cursor: pointer; width: 408px; height: 303px;" src="http://www.flightglobal.com/assets/getAsset.aspx?ItemID=18768" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /></div><br />The<a href="http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/neo/report2007.html"> Near Earth Object Program</a> studied non nuclear alternatives, but apparently the nuclear device is one or two orders of magnitude more efficient and<a href="http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/08/03/215924/nasa-plans-armageddon-spacecraft-to-blast-asteroid.html"> way cooler</a>.<br /><br />Now we just need Bruce Willis on board and we're set.<br /><br />Via <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/08/08/nasa-draws-up-plans-for-nuke-packing-asteroid-interceptor/">Engadget</a>
