The web has changed (and challenged) most of the traditional business, it's not easy though, it takes a well thought service , a  good interface and a competitive advantage over traditional models to challenge them seriously.<br /><br />Amazon at retail found such a model in reviews and reccomendation from a large and loyal community, iTunes/iPod  instant gratification and convenience got the music industry ( a billion dollar business , that went on for half a century) in the hands of a small computer company in california. A programmer (Cohen) with a good idea for network distribution (Bittorrent) is undermining Movies and TV giants.<br /><br />A lot of small and medium cable and media  companies are actually <span style="font-style: italic;">scared </span>about all this ( and they should be) , either they find a distributor and become content providers, or get out of the way. Statistical data show that TV watching and Movie theater sales decline in direct proportion with broadband usage.<br /><br />There are lots of startups that tried to get into the internet video distribution, YouTube for the casual user, iTunes for small independent video podcast and Network TV series, and the latest one : Joost .<br />If history serves as any indication, the folks over there ( <span style="font-weight: bold;">Niklas Zennstr√∂m</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Janus Friis</span> , makers of <a href="http://www.skype.com/">Skype </a>and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kazaa">Kazaa</a>) are up to shake some old media again.<br /><br />The icing on the cake is they just may have found the killer feature to raise <a href="http://www.joost.com/">Joost </a>over the rest of the video delivery services:  <a href="http://newteevee.com/2007/04/14/joost-its-the-metadata-stupid/">Metadata</a> .<br /><br />If Joost can deliver on the promise of interactive video content, with user participation,  it will be an interesting thing to watch :-) , finally something on TV
