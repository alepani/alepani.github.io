Apparently some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Winer">Winer dude</a> ( I  believe he uses RSS a lot) is complaining about re-posting, I know , It sucks, it has happened to me Dave... :-) . But I 'll try to do it even at a higher level two re-posts and one about a re-post.<br /><br />Om Malik , one of my favorites comentator on the business of tech, has reposted something from Dave himself,  that I find interesting to share, mainly because I've been commenting on  Amazon EC2, Web Services, and the Cloud thing.<br /><br />Something about <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/%7Er/OmMalik/%7E3/261640623/">Talking Pigs and Google</a> that Bezos should be aware of...<br /><br />Another of my favorid business/tech commentators ,  <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolski</a> has written a <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2008/03/17.html">long flamebait about standards</a>.<br /><br />I don't necessary agree with any of the above linked posts but they got me thinking and that's why I check their columns ....<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-family: courier new;"></span>
