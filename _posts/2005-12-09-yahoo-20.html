Om Malik is reporting that <a href="http://gigaom.com/2005/12/09/yahoo-buys-delicious/">yahoo just bought delicious</a>. It makes sense after flickr , now they need to get something like <a href="http://www.flock.com/">flock</a>.  If they release a browser (Flock) or a Firefox toolbar with delicious and yahoo integration, then  it  will be a compelling offer....<br /><br />
