We ( as in <a href="http://www.genexus.com/">genexus </a>) have tried the amazon EC2 service and S3 storage service for developing applications.  They are not cheap, but when you think that you're also paying for reliability ( I mean , how many times the Amazon Store went down in the past 5 years ?  ) it does not sound so bad.<br /><br />Now good old Jeff Bezos is adding more icing to the cake, and I 'm beggining to think he has a master plan after all, and that google should be worrying about AMZN , not yahoo , or Microsoft....<br /><br />Amazon is starting a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/b/ref=sc_fe_c_1_3435361_1/102-8843924-6550514?ie=UTF8&amp;node=342430011&no=3435361&amp;me=A36L942TSJ2AJA">Beta of FPS</a> ( not not a shooter :-)  ) but Flexible Payment Service, a service designed for developers to adopt the amazon payment system, as <a href="http://www.uncov.com/2007/8/3/amazon-takes-on-the-only-web-service-with-hooves">Kyle puts it</a> this could make total sense, you have an e-commerce site, the last thing you want to go bad is payments and if you're using Amazon's service you already have millions ( no kidding) of customers and their pre-approved credit cards in your database. <span style="font-style: italic;">Including mine and probably yours as well</span>.<br /><br /><br /><p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px;">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p>
