Did you read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0553380966/qid=1128733158/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-2588311-2800050?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">The Diamond Age</a> ( Neal Stephenson)? , if not, then go and do it, then come back.<br />Well, now , if a fraction of what the people of <a href="http://www.apollodiamond.com/">Appollo Diamond</a> are claiming is true, a lot of the stuff in the book will become real. <br />They are <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/techinnovations/2005-10-06-man-made-diamonds_x.htm">manufacturing diamonds</a> using a technique called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_vapor_deposition">CVD</a>, the synthetic diamonds will revolutionize everything from jewerly to optics including computers...<br /><br />That would be cool. If I had money left to invest I would surely buy some of their stock....
