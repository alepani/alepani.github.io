If you have already visited the Apple AppStore, you may have noticed that most software there falls into three categories:<br /><ul><li>  Free extensions of online business ( Facebook, Ebay)</li><li>  Cute little games and utilities ( Calories counters, Measuring and Logging, Monkey Ball, etc)</li><li>  And garbage that you can't pay for.</li></ul>The fact that most Aplications are useless, is a sign of the limited toolset ( Mac only) and the first wave of applications, it will get better and hopefuly the killer app will show up, eventually.<br /><br />Facebook  is the best example of the free apps, I haven't found an application worth paying for...<br />and I'm not sure if an "enterprise" app would work on an IPhone. As a personal device is truly brilliant.<br /><br />One of my favorite contenders is Qik ( <a href="http://qik.com/">qik.com</a> ) ( not in the appstore, you need an "open" iphone) , but it is also available also for   Symbian S60 based 3G phones (most new Nokias, and some Motorola and Samsung devices)<br /><br />Qik is live streaming of Video via 3G or Wifi cameraphones and it works increadibly well, the support is extremely good and works everywhere ( 3g or wifi).
