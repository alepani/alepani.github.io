Several companies are rolling up 3G Services in urban areas in Uruguay:<br /><br />State owned Ancel/Antel is focusing in 3g Cellphones, TV, Video, and Video calls, not so much on the data where it has priced itself out of the market.<br /><br />America Movil CTI's services is currently only available as a data service in Montevideo, I suspect using WCDMA or similar technology, sadly it's also expensive ( $u 999 a month, roughly 48 dollars and they have 3GB cap after that the speed goes down to EDGE/GPRS ( 128k ) according to their representarives to "avoid piracy" which means if you need to upload / download heavy work stuff or a patch or worst you have podcast  subscriptions, you're in the same bag as the pirates. Sad.<br /><br />Telefonica's Movistar is the only one getting it apparently, because the salespeople are not very informed , but they have plans from 10 MB up to 10GB and unlimited<br />The Speed is way better than ADSL offered by Antel (landline)<br /><br />I have both a 1.0 MB ADSL line and a 1MB 3g connection from Movistar, here are the results for Montevideo ...<br /><br />Movistar Indoor ( poor reception 3G low speed )<br /><a href="http://www.speedtest.net/"><img src="http://www.speedtest.net/result/216184160.png" /></a><br /><br />Movistar Outdoor 3.5g  great reception<br /><a href="http://www.speedtest.net/"><img src="http://www.speedtest.net/result/216184706.png" /></a><br /><br />Movistar Indoor good reception<br /><a href="http://www.speedtest.net/"><img src="http://www.speedtest.net/result/215652539.png" /></a><br /><br />ANTEL ADSL (indoor)<br /><a href="http://www.speedtest.net/"><img src="http://www.speedtest.net/result/216173700.png" /></a><br /><br />So basically it's cheaper and faster ( at least for download) to go with mobile ( plus you have the convenience of taking it anywhere)  and the connection fees for ADSL are three times the monthly fee so I might just disconnect the ADSL, unfortunately, I need it for work and to connect back home.<br /><br />Upload speed is low in any case but with ADSL you can get up to 256 (that's in theory ) , in reality you get 100 if you're lucky still beats 50 for 3g). nobody seems to have noticed that people produce content as much as they consume it, be it blogs, videos , podcasts, web pages, flash or animations they need to be uploaded. And service providers are assumming they are not here :-(
