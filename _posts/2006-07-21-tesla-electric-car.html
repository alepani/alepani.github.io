This is off-topic even for my usual  standards, but, a California startup, <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/index.php?js_enabled=1">Tesla motors</a> unvailed the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2006/07/19/tesla-roadster-pics-are-out-there/">Tesla roadster</a> an all electric battery powered sport car capable of 0/60 times as low as 4 to 6 secs.<br />Even more interesting, the car is built by Lotus, uses standard laptop  lithium ion batteries, and charges in 3 or 4 hours.<br />check out the videos and specs at <a href="http://www.autoblog.com">autoblog</a>.
