I am trying out the latest version of Ubuntu "Feisty Fawn" 7.04 that was released last week, and I must say I am really impressed.<br /><br />The "live CD" booted normally, the installation used the open source partition manager "GParted" to re-partition the drive and shrink my XP installation , making space for the linux partition.<br />After that, my Windows install was there,  like before, just with less free space :-)<br /><br />The install was fast ,and even asked if I wanted to migrate "My Documents" folders and the favorites for all browsers into Ubuntu.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_12j-6WCLPuM/Rirb3tKC1nI/AAAAAAAAAAM/7q--E3pNsHk/s1600-h/Screenshot.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 497px; height: 332px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_12j-6WCLPuM/Rirb3tKC1nI/AAAAAAAAAAM/7q--E3pNsHk/s320/Screenshot.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5056095281737815666" border="0" /></a><br />The most important part for me is that this is the first linux distro that makes using LAN and wireless networking, truly plug and play , it supports a lot of the current wifi chipsets , including the Intel PROSet wireless from my Toshiba Satellite notebook.<br /><br />Bundled applications are complete: OpenOffice 2.1, Thunderbird 1.x ( I recommend downloading 2.0 version) , FireFox browser, a Desktop search, Gaim IM, FSpot (a picassa-like app for photos) , banshee (music and podcast manager) and a new wiki-like note taking application called Tomboy , wich would be great if there was not Google Docs. :-)<br /><br />I opened Office docs without a flaw, burn CDs  with the included apps; connected to my work network, and connected Thunderbird to the IMAP server and the LDAP repository; also i got to do the same connection from home through open-vpn.<br /><br />All things considered this is a robust desktop operating system; easy to use, and if your work involves mostly web browsing and office it's on par with XP and Vista, and lets you manage multimedia files,  and it does not require a graphic card just for the OS windows.
