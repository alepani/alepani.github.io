I finally got Windows Vista running on my home machine some weeks ago.<br />The hardware I have:  AMD Sempron 2XXX ( kind of oldish), 1.5 Gigs of RAM ; a brand new 200Gb 7200rpm HD,  Video Card  : GForce 5200 with 128 MB.<br /><br />With this hardware windows Vista installed <span style="font-style: italic;">very</span> fast and easier than XP and ran ok.<br /><br />First Impressions:<br /><br />There are a lot of subtle interface details:  OSX like fading, taskbar previews, the  new ALT+TAB  and global search is very well implemented.<br /><br />It is sleek. I digg the new look and the aero theme, widgets, transparency , etc,  aestetically I like it, even  more than the Mac environment,  it is more colorful ( I like colorful); then again you may get tired after a while or may find it distracting,  ( some people said that ), but for now I'm comfortable with it.<br /><br />The included wallpapers are beautiful, nothing particularly cool about the screensavers though, seem to be the same as always, thought; and only one theme !!?<br /><br />There is a lot of work on security under the hood, but it can get very annoying when asked for the fourth time to confirm that you <span style="font-weight: bold;">really</span> want to delete something<br />The global search goes one step ahead of msn search and google desktop by including settings and programs as well as documents, also it it available in every window ( taking a page from the mac).<br /><br />No major crashes, or errors occurred in the first month of using Vista, I installed the usual combination of IMs , browsers, Google earth, development tools VS, Eclipse, Java, etc.<br /><br />Squeak/Smalltalk , my old kids games ( Win 98 and 95 compatibility still there ), played Call of Duty II, Civ. IV etc..... no hardware related issues, overall a very positive feel about this.<br /><br />Some drivers had problems ( mostly a printer and some old cards), but it's to be expected , they are not the Vista drivers.<br /><br />The new media interface is great, finally a decent way to organize photos and music, again well done, it will work great for home users.<br /><br />Overall nothing that has not been done before, but is very well done, consistent, integrated and executed.<br /><br />It is an upgrade over XP , but to call it a "completely new" OS is a bit of a stretch, I find the jump from 2000 to XP to be more significant than the XP to Vista<br /><br />On the con side , I don't like the new interface controls, the option buttons, checks, and  text boxes seem to be overdesigned, and too 3d-ish ; Sometimes it is not clear if they are on or off.<br />The new control panel is a maze, it needs to be more clear on what  you can do and where to do it, sometimes it seems that you can change something, but is just a status dialog and you have to go elsewere to change the options.<br /><br />The users account are flooded by warning security dialogs by default, I had an oder hard disk in wich i installed win XP and I wanted to copy the important data ( docs and photos) and delete everithing else : I have to agree to three screens to delete a file in the docs&amp;settings folder.<br /><br />The endless security nags screens bothered me until I found how to disable and realy make an admin account act like an admin account, maybe this is good for home users , but professionals and power users will find the feature irritating. It has to be disabled on each account.<br /><br />I don't particularly like the new windows explorer, but maybe it's just a matter of getting used to it.<br /><br />In conclusion it is a good upgrade, the look and security screens may put you down, but is is stable, and works. With the right hardware you won't notice the difference with XP . Unfortunately, you won't notice too many new features either.
