And the short list of buzzwords and technologies that IMHO are overhyped or at least are still far from delivering on its promise:<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Podcasting</span>: Seems like a good idea, but it has (yet) no clear advantage over downloading an mp3 using something like  <a href="http://www.bitconjurer.org/">bittorrent</a> , the software lacks polishing and the content is not there.<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Home media receivers</span>: Current offers lack easy of use or quality or both. Wifi connections are not fast enogh to transmit video content, some wireld models are ok, but the software is still not ready, Media Center PCs are too expensive, and too noisy . I'm sticking with my DVD player for now.<br />Eventually the concept  will work, having all your media in one machine makes sense,  but I guess we'lll have to wait for <a href="http://www.xbox360.com/">something </a>more <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000017043956/">consumer friendly</a> to do the trick.<br /><br />Update: <span style="font-style:italic;">I take back what I said on Podcasting!.<br />I've Just found that the lastest iPodder supports bittorrent enclosures, Apple is adding Podcasting support in iTunes/iPod and the <a href="http://www.curry.com">Daily Source Code</a> Rocks ! ( and I was totally wrong)<br /></span>
