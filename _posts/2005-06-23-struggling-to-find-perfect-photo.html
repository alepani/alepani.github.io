Struggling to find the perfect photo aplication for the PC, I've been testing way to many of them, ( and no , iPhoto does not count :-) ) ... <br />First I've tried Adobe's <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshopalbum/starter.html">Photoshop Album</a>, very nice tool (it's a starter edition, so it's not full featured), it works ok, and you can categorize keywords, and tag your photos with them. Also you can add descriptions as metadata in the jpeg File, Some disadvantages are: the publication of photos is  limited and cumbersome, the categories have to be created in a tree( you cannot come up with a keyword on the fly).<br /><br />Picasa was the second aplication I liked , it's overall very similar to Adobe's but I liked the search better, the free format tags also are more easy to add than categories, and the interface is nicer.<br /><br />Both products have the same problem to me and is that of centralized storage, I've found myself swiching machines more often and using my work desktop and my laptop, on diferent days and I wanted something that allowed me to synchronize the photos as well as the metadata. I guess this problem occurs whith almost all the media managers programs photos, video and music ( iTunes for exaple lets you specify the music directory and keeps the metadata there), so you just copy the music directory and you're set, in contrast both Picasa and Adobe put their database in "C:\program Files\.." , needless to say this if you copy photos  between machines you lose the photo tags<br /><br />So I settled for Photoshop Album,and started copying the database ( I think it's an Access file ) every time between my computers. <br />Finally Google purchased Picasa, and with Picasa 2.0 the improvements ( photo fixing and a better time view and support for blogging and photo upload) put it on top of my list.<br />I started to use keywords on jpeg metadata, only to discover I don't have the patience to this. <br />I might end up using just <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> wich makes easy to tag and share photos , no local storage required.<br /><br />I've also tried a number of shareware and open source photo album aplications , and all major manufacturer's Photo apps, but none of them were in the same league ...
