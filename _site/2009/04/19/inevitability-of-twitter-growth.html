  <article class="post-content">
    Some time ago ... <a href="http://apcblog.blogspot.com/2008/05/what-scalability-means.html" rel="BITLY_PROCESSED">I blogged</a> about<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter" rel="BITLY_PROCESSED"> twitter</a>, and how they where having problem with the infrastructure, but it seem they worked it out, now tweeter has exploded again , Big Time, several things had contributed to it:<br /><br /><b>Tool maturity</b>:  There are so many  twitter tools, and devices to Tweet from; that is really impressive, (fowr Windows, Mac, Linux, iPhone, Blackberry, even for the Nintendo DS) ,  , ( a very messy news feed, but a news feed nonetheless ) . Two of the more interesting ones : <a href="http://www.tweetdeck.com/beta/" rel="BITLY_PROCESSED">Twitt Deck (AIR)</a> and <a href="http://www.atebits.com/tweetie-iphone/" rel="BITLY_PROCESSED">Tweetie</a> ( iPhone and soon Mac OS X) which I highly reccommend.<br />Each tool has very good features to help navigate the<i> twitter stream</i> ( search, current themes or 'Trends') what makes getting news and events updates from twitter like following a news feed as <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/aaguiar/archive/2009/04/09/from-google-reader-to-twitter.aspx" rel="BITLY_PROCESSED">Andres points out </a>you just could swith to tweet for news.., but I'm kind of old fashioned and will stay getting news from RSS feed agregators :-)<br /><br /><br /><b>Going Mainstream</b>: Long before the Ashton challenge Twitter began filltering into the News media ( all news programs and major shows provide updates via Twitter), Twitter has a big following ( over 6 million users now), and Is probably the larges social network after FaceBook and MySpace, still a long way to go to match facebook in traffic, but the real number of visits is hard to measure , precisely because of the many tools out there and the SMS interaction than I'm sure many stats don't count.<br /><br />Incidentally Facebook has redesigned havily focused on presenting more updates and I just don't like the way it ended, even after the toning down. Seems like I am getting update from a lot more people I wasn't and I hardly know...<br /><br /><b>Celebrities</b>: Ashton Kutcher challenging CNN over who gets first to 1 million followers on twitter, then @ev and @aplusk appeared on Oprah's show to talk about ... yep.. <span style="font-style: italic;">Twitter</span> , Ashton talked about the state of media and even mentioned digg.com. Bonus: Shaq tells Oprah that She was wwriting in ALL CAPS...  How is that not surreal...!<br /><br />The main focus of Twitter now has to be regaining stability with millions of users instead of hundreths of thousands, and finding a way to get the money back... without making the mistakes Facebokk made of forcing news or updates on people. Some possible models for this is a paid-for API for the tool makers, a flickr style paid for premium ( where the big folowwed or the big followers would pay for mumber of users over any big number), or a revenue model for celebrity followers. Any of those would potentially alienate the still new growing userbase...maybe they could be a open source "foundation model"... who knows. I have a theory about why this startups with no business model grow and live so long, but that's for another time.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_12j-6WCLPuM/SevbODd2c8I/AAAAAAAAALY/z2cpryOC194/s1600-h/twitter.png" imageanchor="1" rel="BITLY_PROCESSED" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_12j-6WCLPuM/SevbODd2c8I/AAAAAAAAALY/z2cpryOC194/s400/twitter.png" border="0" /></a></div><br /><br />Right now twitter is down, again, probably as a result of the "Oprah surge"(1) and its aftermath. But I got a feeling they are getting a recovery soon. And they are in for a big growth.......<br /><br /><br />(1) from  @ryanblock " The Oprah Effect: Twitter's added over 1.5m new users between Friday and today. Damn." so are we talking 25% more in userbase in a weekend ?
