    It's the end !<br /><br />Another year, Christmas presents and of course : lists !<br /><br />The Best of, Worst of, etc. I recommended a good amount of books this year , and haven't got the time to get into all the games that I asked Santa for, so I am listing the most interesting technologies looking forward into 2008 and beyond...<br /><br />As they say prediction is difficult, especially of the future, so I won't make any warranties or claims , only that this stuff is interesting...<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">          Genetic diagnostic and treatment</span>.<br />       It's getting easier to screen for genetic diseases, and contrary to wat most people think, it's not a Gattaca-like scenario, but it means early treatment and perhaps cure for thusands of people suffering degenerative diseases.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />Robots</span><br />       Started as Toys, and japanese novelty, now we have Roombas cleaning the floor and kids taking Robotic courses in school using Legos. The next generation will be as comfortable programing robots as we are with computers.  I think really cool stuff is coming in this area.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">         New materials</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">and devices</span>.<br />Some news this year about interest breakthroughs in micro engineering, material science, and energy,  and creating composite materials that give us a glimpse of the future, where reality is actually stranger than fiction.<br />I'm talking <a href="http://www.sptimes.com/2004/07/08/Worldandnation/Have_a_light_Then_you.shtml">concrete see-through walls</a>, <a href="http://www.fs-world.com/Print.asp?id=3222&amp;url=http://www.fs-world.com/Show.asp?ID=3222&amp;Form=5">water that does not get you wet</a>, and <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/12/19/toshibas-building-a-micro-nuclear-reactor-for-your-garage/">backyard nuclear reactors</a>.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">          Computer  Virtualization software.</span><br />       True it's not new, but is finally caching up, we got three big players, VMware, MS Virtual PC and Parallels, some really nice ideas ( <a href="http://ptn.parallels.com/en/ptn/pva/htbuild/">Virtual appliances</a> in Parallells , transforming real machines into Virtual ones, etc,) cool enabling technology ( multicore CPUs, Intel virtualization hardware)<br />Some interesting stuff going on there.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">         The "Cloud"</span> everybody from GDrive to Amazon is getting into the Hardware as a Service business.  online backup services abound. First, it  was your data online, then the documents, identity ( Google Checkout ), and office applications now is even in house aps and web servers ( se Amazon ECC , and now Databases with Amazon SimpleDB). Clearly off line applications are OUT. which leads to my next point....<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">         Always on , Always connected</span>, thanks to Wifi ubiquity, 3G services,  and cheap net access you can get connection from everywhere, bandwith is the new electricity, sure , you can live without it, but why would you ?  You have your cellphone, your laptop , even  your Videogame machines connected 24/7. No need to miss anything.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Digital Homes</span><br />Will become a reality in the next years, there are many mature "media center" platforms, standarized HiDef formats ( H.264, WMV and DivX ), network speed make streaming of audio easy and video is coming nice too. Soon If you don't have all your photos, music collections and movies available in every TV and every device you will be the exception.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">        The Net taking over TV</span>. Bittorrent + iTunes + Youtube , it's too late people, get a new job.<br /><br />I have a lot of things that I would love to see in products in the next years, but I probably won't  hit even one so I leave it at that..<div><br /></div>
