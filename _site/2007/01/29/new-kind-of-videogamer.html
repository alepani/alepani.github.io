  <article class="post-content">
    For many people, modern innovation in gaming began with the 3D engine or with the analog controls in the Nintendo64...in some sense this is true; but the innovation we are seeing now it's a different kind, the type which will not only bring better games , more engaging  games but games so different from what we ( regular gamers) are used to, that many will not see them as games at all.<br /><br />The most notable example of this type of thing is Nintendo, and I am not talking only about the Wii controller, wich is in fact innovative.<br /><br />The NintendoDS is a great  example of a different kind of  system, but the graphic power is not nearly close as the PSP, yet is has been outselling the PSP for a wide margin in almost every market; the reason: original and great games, it's all it takes.<br /><br />From "games" where you make numeric tests and sudoku (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-45496737122-Brain-Age/dp/B000EGELP0/sr=1-1/qid=1170133412/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-3696217-9956610?ie=UTF8&s=videogames">Brain Age</a>), to games where secret agents must keep the beat of music ( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-NTRPAOSE-Elite-Beat-Agents/dp/B000HE9LL8/sr=1-1/qid=1170133321/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-3696217-9956610?ie=UTF8&amp;s=videogames">Elite beat agents</a>) or where you make your own music guiding creatures (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-DSNIN-045496737061-Electroplankton/dp/B000CI8EXA/sr=1-149/qid=1170133138/ref=sr_1_149/103-3696217-9956610?ie=UTF8&s=videogames">Elecroplankton</a>)  ; to virtual pet games (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_vg/103-3696217-9956610?url=search-alias%3Dvideogames&field-keywords=nintendogs&amp;amp;amp;amp;Go.x=0&Go.y=0&amp;Go=Go">Nintendogs</a>) where your "puppy" lives in the systems , gets fed, catches a ball and  recognize tour voice commands, and even go to other DSes to play with other dogs.<br />One of several minigames in the new Super Mario makes you blow air into the microphone to lift a character and his balloons.<br /><br /><br />Of course the Wii is another great example of this type of game in the creative use of a new input device Wii sports it's probably the best executed game , as developers come with new ideas for the remote the Wii will remain a home of new and original titles.<br /><br />Sony also uses motion control ( in a more limited way ) in the PS3 controller and has not be shown to be of great use at this time, but some games ( most notably Lair ) are coming.<br /><br />However, the innovation in different games from the Sony software side has been there since PS2:<br />The EyeToy camera can track your movements ( no remote needed) and map them into the game; the new version works over IP and it's supposed to be better yet. Some PS3 Games will take advantage of this feature to map real object and overlay them in-game ( <a href="http://ps3.ign.com/objects/775/775515.html">Eye of Judgement</a>) .<br />The other interesting game is <a href="http://www.psu.com/node/7395">Singstar Online</a>; it's like a karaoke game only the game check if you hit the pitch correctly and points you for that and you can upload your performance to the Playstation Network. ( think DDR but singing instead of dancing and combine it with myspace )<br /><br />The third area is letting users create limited games withing the network creating a positive feedback loop ( Microsoft is on that path with "creator's club" in XBox Live)<br />Sony and Nintendo are also offering downloadable minigames ( not user created yet) but that will come for sure.<br /><br />This are the kind of games that appeal to people who never touched a console before, the Nintendo strategy ( expanding the market) is the correct one. I hope that the others will follow it.<br /><br /><br />PS: An I almost forgot about Spore, this may as well be the game I am most looking forward to play in 2007 , is a unique game in many ways. There is a <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3157178">good interview with creator Will Wright here</a>.
