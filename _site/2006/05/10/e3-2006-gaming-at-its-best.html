    <br />I'm not into making predictions, but after checking out E3 conferences and impressions I have decided that Nintendo is the one who will actually gain market share from Sony in the next cycle ( Sony will lose ground , Microsoft will probably remain the same or grow a little):<br /><br />SONY: The PS3 will cost 500/600 dollars , that's a lot for even hardcore gamers, the games look great but many lack polish and most are at or less than  30% complete. The fact that they are copying Xbox Live from MS,  and motion sensibility from  nintendo doesn't halp at all. The only reason I might buy one (after the price drops) is Gran Turismo HD.<br />They are probably still selling below the cost, because BD disks are expensive and the high end model has wifi and HDMI built in, and both models include an internal hard disk.  So in comparison to current Xbox prices , it doesnt look so bad.  I wonder how much the Xbox HD-DVD drive will sell for...?<br /><br /><br />MICROSOFT: They seem to have a problem reaching large numbers outside the US, It's almost as expensive as the PS3 and the best feature (Xbox live) require internet connection and a subscription, PGR3 plays exactly like PGR2 and Halo3 will probably a hi-def version of Halo2.<br />They have a strong gaming line up, mostly FPS and the like ( I am not a big fan, last time I played a FPS and completed it, it  was on the Quake  engine :-) )<br />They also showed a lot of features to connect with Xbox with your computer, wich ( get this) , will <em>require</em> Vista to use.<br /><br />NINTENDO: They are kicking PSP with lower res graphics and better ideas with the DS. <br />The DS is selling out, with innovative games like brain age, they have a  special version of the opera browser and will incorporate Voip...<br /><br />Can they do the same with the Wii ? After seeing Miyamoto direct an orchestra and play tennis, I'm tempted to say yes....Also they will have DVD, an Opera Browser for wii, one handed control with 3d motion sensor, speaker and feedback, always on internet connection, virtual console with old games, including sega and others, backwards compatible with gamecube..<br />The only drawback may be underpower graphics and CPU, but will have to wait for that.<br />Oh I almost forgot they own some little known franchises Zelda, Metroid, Pokemon, Super Smash and Mario :-) <br /><br />Some friends that have never bought a console are decided to get the Wii, some PS2 owners I know decided they won't pay for a console 500 dollars..and are thinking about getting on the Wii bandwagon also ....<br />I'm definetely <em>getting </em>one you know , for the kids :-)<br /><br />Check out the coverage for e3 at  <a href="http://www.engadget.com">Engadget</a> and <a href="http://ign.com">IGN </a><br /><br />On the PC side <a href="http://pc.ign.com/objects/694/694190.html">Crysis</a> from CryTek and <a href="http://www.spore.com/">Spore </a>are the games I am really eager to play. <br /><br /><br />
