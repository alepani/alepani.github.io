    <br />The smartphone revolution is at it's peek now, with a clear picture of &nbsp;winners ( Google 's Android, Apple's iOS , LG, Samsung, HTC) ; and losers ( RIM's Blackberry, Nokia, MSFT, etc)<br /><br />The Success of the smartphone is not just based on how powerful the devices are or the features , but more importantly the ability to do two things that were previously , very hard, very expensive or just impossible a decade or two ago:<br /><br /><h3>#1 &nbsp;Sense the environment and information.</h3><div>The connected, sensor full phone knows a lot about the environment, time, location, voice, &nbsp;movement, outside conditions: &nbsp;light, &nbsp;noise, weather ( from servers), etc.&nbsp;</div><div>It also can connect with the user's database, social networks, applications, documents, calendars, contact, infer relations, importance of meetings or messages</div><div><br /></div><div>This information user-data + environmental data &nbsp;make the device aware of the present situation and it's context in a way that personal computers previously couldn't possible be; thus opening the door for a number of highly innovative applications which will only continue to grow.<br /><br /><br /></div><div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZBIOgkc3r1A/UgZaD1YJA2I/AAAAAAAAARU/OZgZueMAyt0/s1600/google-glass-main.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZBIOgkc3r1A/UgZaD1YJA2I/AAAAAAAAARU/OZgZueMAyt0/s320/google-glass-main.jpg" width="320" /></a><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZBIOgkc3r1A/UgZaD1YJA2I/AAAAAAAAARU/OZgZueMAyt0/s1600/google-glass-main.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><br /></a><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZBIOgkc3r1A/UgZaD1YJA2I/AAAAAAAAARU/OZgZueMAyt0/s1600/google-glass-main.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><br /></a><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZBIOgkc3r1A/UgZaD1YJA2I/AAAAAAAAARU/OZgZueMAyt0/s1600/google-glass-main.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><br /></a><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZBIOgkc3r1A/UgZaD1YJA2I/AAAAAAAAARU/OZgZueMAyt0/s1600/google-glass-main.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><br /></a><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZBIOgkc3r1A/UgZaD1YJA2I/AAAAAAAAARU/OZgZueMAyt0/s1600/google-glass-main.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><br /></a><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HQc1RReesuo/UgZZyIQY_FI/AAAAAAAAARE/A3L8_JThswI/s1600/673474abf712c744534e4fc43318f1a0.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="212" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HQc1RReesuo/UgZZyIQY_FI/AAAAAAAAARE/A3L8_JThswI/s320/673474abf712c744534e4fc43318f1a0.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /></div><h3>#2 Connect people and events 24/7</h3><div><br /></div><div>In today world you can leave your house without keys or without a wallet , but if you leave without your smartphone, you go back. You just can't be "out of reach"</div><div>Some of this is fabricated ( you don't need to be available at all times, or check facebook or twitter every 5 minutes ) , but some maybe not. We humans need information like we need food and an internet-conected phone my just be as addictive as sugar o potato chips.</div><div><br /></div><div>We are able now to know our friends location without asking them, we can send messages to our family members in five or six different written or spoken ways.&nbsp;</div><div>Check in to work , or see what our closest friends or celebrities from around the world are doing RIGHT NOW just as easy as we see the world's news unfold on twitter hours before they appear on CNN.</div><div><br /></div><div>The combination of awareness and connection is what makes the applications on a phone so powerful and the market so attractive. We have taken the network of communication that goes around the planet and taken from the stillness of the office desks to our pockets and the dynamics of the physical wold.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><h2>The new frontier(s)</h2><div>So, what's left ?<br /><br />What is the next frontier to connect. In short , everything else.<br /><br />This is what is called Smart Things or Smart Objects.<br /><br />The idea is embedding everyday objects with sensors and transmitting capability: Your Home: doors, windows, alarms, appliances, lights, etc; your car Information in your dashboard and transmitting wireless to your phone and servers ( i.e. the cloud ) ; and even yourself : heart rate monitoring, exercise logging, etc.<br /><br /><h4><br />The car interface</h4></div><div><br />Apple is pushing very hard to get iOS in the car . This is necessary to get &nbsp;iOS everywhere in your life , and leverage Apple's main advantage , integration across devices.<br />Right now there are proprietary solutions starting to emerge in some cars, the ideal situation would be to have some standards independent of the vendor and a profile that you can "log in" independent of the car you use. Microsoft is already trying some of this with limited success.<br /><br />I'm pretty confident that this will happen in the next 3-5 years at least with Apple, Google , and others.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://cdn0.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/car%20tech/BMW/ConnectedDrive%202103/BMW%20ConnectedDrive%202013%20(10)-580-90.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="179" src="http://cdn0.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/car%20tech/BMW/ConnectedDrive%202103/BMW%20ConnectedDrive%202013%20(10)-580-90.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><h4></h4><h4>Wearables ( Quantified self )</h4>The wearables computer trend started a long ago, but the practical applications appeared only recently with the Apple / Nike+ sensor and its competitors.<br /><br />Today the market is full of sensor devices used to track everything related to health , from your physical activity, to your sleep and weight.<br /><br />The health monitoring use of computing embedded fabrics with sensors coupled with high powered clout computer is big.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://superapple.cz/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Nike-+-FuelBand-2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="180" src="http://superapple.cz/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Nike-+-FuelBand-2.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><br /><h4>The (new) Smart home</h4><br />Home automation has been around for years, but thanks to a convergence of difference technologies, &nbsp;now may actually happen.<br /><br />The cloud services reliable centralizing the information; your Phone or tablet acting as an information dashboard and remote control where you can also extend the functionality by adding applications, programs and rules; &nbsp;and the miniaturizationa and commoditization of automation hardware ( Bluetooth sensors, cheap wifi components, small integrated Pico-computer boards ( Arduino, RaspBerry PI , etc)<br /><br />Some of the current players in this space include<br /><br /><br />Most systems use the phone as a remote/control centre and a central hub that link the sensors with the server.<br /><br />An open API is essential for this to take off , &nbsp;but the potential for malicious hacking in all three scenarios remain very high.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/projects/286806/photo-main.jpg?1344449605" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/projects/286806/photo-main.jpg?1344449605" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><br />I'm interested in what applications will come from this , especially for the home automation side, and in what ways either of this three things ( Car / Home / Body) can be combined in a single service.<br /><br /><br /></div>
