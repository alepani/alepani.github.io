  <article class="post-content">
    I just bought my last CD, I 've tried , but it was enough, I paid retail price for a new CD, I couldn't play it in my PC, I can't copy it (to use it in the car without scratching the original), and I can't rip it to my PC. I don't think any of those activities are illegal, but the CD is a pain to use and it's a 20 year old technology crippled by copy protection that, of course, only bothers those who buy the original, not the people who download songs from pirate sites, and certainly not the pirates.<br /><br />Enter Apple, after sellign the 500 millionth ( yes that's a lot) song from itunes,  they are on a race with Microsoft and others to cut deals to <a href="http://www.gearlive.com/index.php/news/article/apples_digital_media_trinity_coming_soon_07180243/">complete the media landscape</a>, selling videos and movies, at least according to the rumors.<br /><br />The music CD is dead because ( in my opinion) several factors, first digital distribution (legal or not) is inevitable, and ,thanks to the Labels illegal is the dominant one, then legal old CDs are a steal, they cost 12 to 18 dollars, almost as much as a DVD, and to top that they "protected" so you can't use it as you would like to.<br /><br />DVDs on the other hand are relatively a good deal, you get a million dollar (sometimes 100 million) work for 20 or 30 dollars, that you can watch anywhere, there is a healthy rental market and a lot of people collecting classic and favorite movies.<br /><br />Of course, piracy still exists, digital distribution is inevitable, but it's still up to the film companies to decide whether they want to be legal or illegal, in order to succeed legal downloads has to be<br /><br />  1. A bit cheaper than buying a DVD<br />  2. Reasonable protected ( I want to copy at least to my dvd player and/or pc if I want., bak it up and restore in a different machine years from now, etc.<br />  3. Widely supported by all studios<br />  4. Easy to use.<br /><br />If they do that and don't mess with the current DVD format they won't loose the market to illegal downloads, people don't download songs from Kazaa because they want to steal music, they do it because it's easier than buying a CD, and you get a song you can actually listen to anywhere you want...<br /><br />8/17/2005 <span style="font-style: italic;">Update: Carlo Longino has had a <a href="http://mobhappy.typepad.com/russell_buckleys_mobhappy/2005/08/why_drm_will_ki.html">similar experience</a> and predict the death of digital music industry.<br />         There is however hope, in independent artists, check out the <a href="http://music.podshow.com/">podsafe music network</a></span>
